It works by slowing down the movement of chemicals in the brain that may become unbalanced. This results in a reduction in nervous tension (anxiety).</p>\r\n<p>Alprazolam is used to treat anxiety disorders, panic disorders, and anxiety caused by depression.</p>\r\n<p>Alprazolam may also be used for purposes not listed in this medication guide.</p>\r\n<a id="safety"></a><h5>Important information about alprazolam</h5>\r\n<p>Do not use alprazolam if you are pregnant. It could harm the unborn baby. Do not use this medication if you are allergic to alprazolam or to other benzodiazepines, such as chlordiazepoxide (Librium), clorazepate (Tranxene), diazepam (Valium), lorazepam (Ativan), or oxazepam (Serax).</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Before you take alprazolam, tell your doctor if you have asthma or other breathing problems, glaucoma, kidney or liver disease, a history of alcoholism, or a history of depression, suicidal thoughts, or addiction to drugs or alcohol</p>\r\n<p>Do not drink alcohol while taking alprazolam. This medication can increase the effects of alcohol. Alprazolam may be habit-forming and should be used only by the person for whom it was prescribed. Keep the medication in a secure place where others cannot get to it.</p>\r\n<a id="before-using"></a><h5>Before taking alprazolam</h5>\r\n<p>It is dangerous to try and purchase alprazolam on the Internet or from vendors outside of the United States. Medications distributed from Internet sales may contain dangerous ingredients, or may not be distributed by a licensed pharmacy. Samples of alprazolam purchased on the Internet have been found to contain haloperidol (Haldol), a potent antipsychotic drug with dangerous side effects. For more information, contact the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or visit www.fda.gov/buyonlineguide.</p>\r\n<p>You should not take alprazolam if you have:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>\r\n<p>narrow-angle glaucoma;</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p>if you are also taking itraconazole (Sporanox) or ketoconazole (Nizoral); or</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p>if you are allergic to alprazolam or to other benzodiazepines, such as chlordiazepoxide (Librium), clorazepate (Tranxene), diazepam (Valium), lorazepam (Ativan), or oxazepam (Serax).</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>To make sure you can safely take alprazolam, tell your doctor if you have any of these other conditions:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>\r\n<p>asthma, emphysema, bronchitis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder (COPD), or other breathing problems;</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p>glaucoma;</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p>kidney or liver disease (especially alcoholic liver disease);</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p>a history of depression or suicidal thoughts or behavior; or</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p>a history of drug or alcohol addiction.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Alprazolam may be habit forming and should be used only by the person for whom it was prescribed. Never share alprazolam with another person, especially someone with a history of drug abuse or addiction.

Alprazolam may also cause addiction or withdrawal symptoms in a newborn if the mother takes the medication during pregnancy. Use effective birth control, and tell your doctor if you become pregnant during treatment. Alprazolam can pass into breast milk and may harm a nursing baby. You should not breast-feed while you are using this medicine. The sedative effects of alprazolam may last longer in older adults. Accidental falls are common in elderly patients who take benzodiazepines. Use caution to avoid falling or accidental injury while you are taking alprazolam.

Do not take in larger or smaller amounts or for longer than recommended. Follow the directions on your prescription label. Your doctor may occasionally change your dose to make sure you get the best results.</p>\r\n<p>Do not crush, chew, or break an extended-release tablet. Swallow the pill whole. It is specially made to release medicine slowly in the body. Breaking the pill would cause too much of the drug to be released at one time.</p>\r\n<p>Measure the liquid form of alprazolam with a special dose-measuring spoon or cup, not a regular table spoon. If you do not have a dose-measuring device, ask your pharmacist for one.</p>\r\n<p>Do not swallow the orally disintegrating tablets whole. Allow it to dissolve in your mouth without chewing.</p>\r\n<p>Contact your doctor if this medicine seems to stop working as well in treating your panic or anxiety symptoms.</p>\r\n<p>You may have seizures or withdrawal symptoms when you stop using alprazolam. Ask your doctor how to avoid withdrawal symptoms when you stop using alprazolam.</p>\r\n<p>Keep track of the amount of medicine used from each new bottle.

(4, 'USPHS: Where Pharmacy Meets Public Health', 'The US Public Health Service (USPHS) Commissioned Corps was established in 1889 to help protect US citizens from infectious diseases through immunization and quarantine. As the nation&#39;s public health needs grew, so did the corps.<br />\n	<br />\n	Today, the USPHS Commissioned Corps consists of more than 6000 full-time, highly skilled professionals from a number of health care fields. All pharmacists in the Corps are uniformed officers, and they serve throughout the US Department of Health and Human Services and in other federal agencies.<br />\n	<br />\n	Rear Admiral Scott F. Giberson, assistant surgeon general and chief pharmacy officer, USPHS Commissioned Corps, says, &ldquo;PHS Pharmacy allows for unparalleled diversity and opportunity. Our pharmacists become an integral part of a unique career path that can involve advanced pharmacy practice, health policy development, emergency and humanitarian response, public health leadership, global health, and much more.&rdquo;<br />\n	<br />\n	<strong>DIVERSE OPPORTUNITIES </strong><br />\n	<br />\n	According to the USPHS Commissioned Corps Web site, the mission of the corps is to provide for the health and safety of the nation through &ldquo;rapid and effective response to public health needs, leadership and excellence in public health practices, and advancement of public health science.&rdquo;<br />\n	<br />\n	Captain Carmen Clelland, PharmD, MPA, director of the Health Professions Support Branch of the Indian Health Service, says that the majority of career opportunities in the corps are focused on patient care and counseling. Captain Clelland explains, &ldquo;There are many opportunities for recent graduates with the corps. Primary care, ambulatory care, and institutional practice opportunities include working with the Indian Health Service, Division of Immigration Health Services, and US Coast Guard. Many initiatives of these 3 organizations allow pharmacists to utilize their clinical skills recently learned in pharmacy school.&rdquo;<br />\n	<br />\n	For recent graduates who are interested in policymaking, academia, or administration, other agencies can provide important employment opportunities. The FDA, for example, has many regulatory positions for which pharmacists provide their expertise and knowledge. Other agencies, such as the Health Care Financing Administration, Health Resource and Services Administration, National Institutes of Health, Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, utilize more senior Corps pharmacists.<br />\n	<br />\n	<strong>GETTING COMMISSIONED</strong><br />\n	<br />\n	To become a member of the Commissioned Corps, pharmacy graduates must be citizens of the United States, be aged 44 years or younger, and pass a physical examination.<br />\n	<br />\n	Pharmacy graduates also need to hold a Bachelor of Science or PharmD degree from a program accredited by the American Council on Pharmaceutical Education. Corps candidates need a current, valid, and unrestricted pharmacy license for one of the 50 states, Washington, DC, Puerto Rico, the US Virgin Islands, or Guam. Recent pharmacy graduates who do not yet have a valid license may still apply to the corps, but will be appointed for a limited tour of duty until licensure is complete.<br />\n	<br />\n	Once accepted into the Commissioned Corps, the required length of service is 2 years with the same agency. After that term, corps pharmacists have the opportunity to apply for positions at different agencies.<br />\n	<br />\n	<strong>BENEFITS ABOUND</strong><br />\n	<br />\n	The benefits of a career with the Commissioned Corps are generous. New pharmacists who enroll in the corps receive a host of benefits, including competitive starting pay, free medical and dental care for the pharmacist and low-cost medical care for family members, tax-free housing and meal allowances, 30 days paid vacation, and paid sick and maternity leaves.<br />\n	<br />\n	For newly commissioned pharmacists, the Commissioned Corps offers a $30,000 accession bonus for signing a 4-year active-duty agreement. Pharmacists serving in the corps may also be eligible for an annual $15,000 retention bonus.<br />\n	<br />\n	In recognition of the financial burden a pharmacy student accepts by going through professional schooling, the USPHS, in coordination with other federal agencies, also offers loan repayment and other educational and family support programs for those who qualify.<br />\n	<br />\n	Captain Clelland notes that there are nonmonetary benefits to a career in the corps as well. Flexibility and career growth are 2 big benefits to a career in the corps&mdash;in his 20-year career with the IHS, Captain Clelland has served in both rural and urban settings, and has had the opportunity to take positions in patient care, administration, and policymaking.<br />\n	<br />\n	Although the Commissioned Corps maintains a low profile in the national consciousness, it provides valuable services to benefit public health in our country and around the world. Rear Admiral Giberson says, &ldquo;We [in the Commissioned Corps] desire professionals and pharmacists that want to serve a mission, become part of something special, and that want to make a difference in the lives of people.&rdquo;<br />\n	<br />\n	<strong>FOR STUDENTS ONLY </strong><br />\n	<br />\n	The Commissioned Corps also has programs for current students. Students who have completed at least 1 year of study in a master&rsquo;s or doctoral program or 2 years in a professionally accredited bachelor&rsquo;s program may qualify for the Junior Commissioned Officer Student Training and Extern Program (JRCOSTEP). JRCOSTEP participants work in the same types of positions as commissioned officers, and enjoy some of the same benefits. Assignments in JRCOSTEP last from 31 to 120 days, and are scheduled during school breaks and the summer months. Students are paid for their time and are not obligated to join the corps upon graduation.<br />\n	<br />\n	A similar program, the Senior Commissioned Officer Student Training and Extern Program (SRCOSTEP), was created for full-time students entering their last year of professional training in an accredited program. SRCOSTEP participants receive financial assistance to complete school, and agree to serve in the corps after graduation for twice the amount of the time for which they received assistance. Students interested in the JRCOSTEP and SRCOSTEP programs can check their eligibility at https://dcpweb.psc.gov/ rab/scripts/app_main_menu.htm.<br />\n	<br />\n	<strong>JOINING THE CORPS</strong><br />\n	<br />\n	Pharmacy students who are interested in careers with the USPHS Commissioned Corps should call 800-279-1605 for more information.

The aim is to encourage young and not-so-young professionals in the diaspora who are trying to make the decision of whether to move back to Nigeria. In collaboration with the brilliant team at MoveBackToNigeria.com, we hope to bring you a weekly interview with individuals who have successfully made the leap. The idea is to share their successes and their challenges as they made the decision.\r\n\r\nA lot of Nigerians in the diaspora have questions about making a change at home in Nigeria. Many suggest really good ideas on how to make things better; others would like to contribute to making a difference back home but are just not sure where to begin.\r\n\r\nThis week, we excitedly bring you a feature on a young Nigerian pharmacist (he  has chosen to remain anonymous) who is moving back to Nigeria to pursue his dreams in the health sector and beyond. Read on, to hear him talk about his career so far, his hopes and plans for his pharmaceutical practice and his take on the pharmaceutical industry in Nigeria. We hope you enjoy reading his story.\r\n\r\nThanks for agreeing to speak to us. Could you kindly tell us who you are?\r\nI’m a young Nigerian pharmacist, living and working in London, England and looking to move back to Nigeria in the next few months. My interests range from sports to music and everything in between.\r\n\r\nWhen did you leave Nigeria and why?\r\nI left Nigeria for the UK in 2001 for educational reasons.\r\n\r\nCan you shed some light on these educational reasons?\r\nSure. I left Nigeria after secondary school to do my A Levels in the UK and subsequently attend university there as well.  I studied pharmacy at Cardiff University and graduated with a Masters in Pharmacy.\r\n\r\nDid you always know you wanted to be a pharmacist?\r\nNot necessarily. Whilst I was proficient in science subjects, I was not always sure of what science I wanted to practice. My dad then decided on pharmacy and I’m happy to say it’s turned out to be a worthy decision.\r\n\r\nThat’s certainly fortunate. So how did your career in pharmacy begin?\r\nWell, it’s a seemingly convoluted path so do bear with me as I narrate. In the UK, after studying pharmacy, there’s a 1 year mandatory ‘pre-registration’ program (similar to the housemanship in medicine) which involves 1 year of working, shadowing a pharmacist and a very challenging professional exam afterwards. I undertook mine at Tesco Pharmacy, thankfully passed the exams and then registered as a pharmacist in the UK. I then went back to Cardiff University for another Masters degree, this time in Strategic Marketing as I felt that my business skills were lacking and I needed to remedy that. This I did for long term reasons because, I knew I would one day be going back to Nigeria to set up a pharmacy and I wanted to have the entrepreneurial skills necessary to market my drugs. After this degree, I got a job at Superdrug which lasted only briefly as the visa rules got changed and so I had to prematurely leave the UK for Nigeria.\r\n\r\nAlthough I was somewhat disillusioned at the prospect, I decided to use the opportunity to undertake the NYSC program. However, when I got home, I realised that I was misinformed about the NYSC procedure, particularly as it applies to graduates of medicine and pharmacy. You have to register as a pharmacist and then take a 6week course which is rotated nationwide and runs once annually, before being eligible for NYSC. I had unfortunately arrived months before the course and did not relish the prospect of waiting idly which led me to decide to come back to the UK for a third Masters degree, this time in Global Affairs at the University of Buckingham. I did this alongside a part-time pharmacist job in Boots and I stayed with them, even after the completion of my course while planning another move back to Nigeria; this time much more thought out and researched. After Boots, a better opportunity presented itself at Sainsbury’s Pharmacy and I took it and that’s where I currently work as the pharmacy manager.\r\n\r\nYou’ve mentioned a few times, your unwavering intent to return to Nigeria. Why this mindset?\r\nMoving back to Nigeria should be a decision based on personal circumstances. After all is said and done and despite the very well documented infrastructural and societal challenges in Nigeria, there’s still nowhere like home. I have a very good job in the UK and live a comfortable life but I feel that going home now is the right thing to do, for me.  I would like to be closer to my family, most of whom reside there and I would also like to set up my pharmacy practice in Nigeria, God willing. It is where I want to be and where I am happiest.\r\n\r\nWhilst I’m there, the intent is to get some hands on work experience, register my company and prepare for NYSC. Another reason is that there is a huge influx of pharmacists into the UK and so the money is not even what it used to be. The sector here is also getting very saturated for instance, because of EU laws, pharmacists from eastern Europe can come to the UK, shadow a pharmacist for a month and then get their license irrespective of whatever sort of training (or not) they may received in their home countries.\r\n\r\nThat’s understandable. You have discussed setting up your Pharmacy in Nigeria, can you go into some detail and tell us what this would entail?\r\nMy background in pharmacy and business has prepared me for this and it is something I want to do for a myriad of reasons. Operating a small, retail pharmacy is a profitable venture, it is also one that by its very nature will meet a very basic human need as I plan to site it close to schools, hospitals and potentially also specialise in certain medication(s), be a distributor, supplying private and public establishments and much more. I’m very optimistic about moving back and while I am very aware that things don’t always turn out as planned, particularly in the uncertain Nigerian terrain, I’m just hoping for the best.\r\n\r\nThis naturally leads us to the pharmaceutical industry in Nigeria and bodies like PCN & NAFDAC. What are your thoughts regarding these regulatory bodies?\r\nThe pharmaceutical industry in Nigeria is definitely progressing.  However, I feel we need to start manufacturing more medicines in Nigeria. The obvious infrastructural challenges certainly pose obstacles to this but it’s an area that should be better explored. We need more companies like Emzor, Orange Drugs and so on as a lot of medicines are currently imported from India and China which is not the route I would personally take if given the opportunity. There is more that can be done to increase our production especially considering we have the raw materials in abundance and a good example of this is maize starch which is a major component of most medicines.\r\n\r\nThe regulatory agencies like NAFDAC (National Agency for Food & Drug Administration and Control) and PCN (Pharmacists Council of Nigeria) need to be empowered and constitutionalized so as to be more effective and also to eliminate the crippling bureaucracy.  There are existing policies which go a long way towards curbing illegal practices. Many people are not aware of the existing industry rules and this is due to the fact that they are hardly enforced. One such rule is one in which if a businessman wants to set up a pharmacy, there must an in-house pharmacist who must own at least 40% of the business so as to ensure best practice. The PCN also needs to organise more public enlightenment campaigns for citizens to be aware of the laws and policies. For instance medication like Valium and Lexotan by law are prescription only in Nigeria but a lot of people flout these stipulations.\r\n\r\nWhat unique opportunities exist in the industry for people who may also be considering a move back?\r\nThere are many opportunities that abound, just take the size of Nigeria into consideration. There are 36 states in Nigeria with each one presenting a unique opportunity to whoever is interested and with the wherewithal to power the interest. For instance, I know someone who lives in Delta State but chooses to travel to the neighbouring Edo State to purchase medication for her kids when the need arises. There might be pharmacies close to her but she chooses to go all the way and it may be a function of the origin of the drugs sold by the pharmacies. She may just prefer European brands such as GSK or Roche to the Asian brands which are what abound in Nigeria and so here exists an opportunity for a business venture. Also, the WHO states that the fake drugs market In Africa is worth millions of dollars and we have a lot of people coming in from neighbouring countries like Ghana and Cameroon to buy medicines in Nigeria and so this is another opportunity to come in and present an ethical and alternative change.\r\n\r\nThis is all very enlightening and you’re clearly very passionate about this cause. Where then, do you see yourself and potentially, your pharmacy in 3 to 5 years?\r\nHopefully in a stable and successful position.  I intend to eventually expand and open more branches of my pharmacy as well as be a key player in the sector. I have already started the legwork and so with hard work and God’s blessings, the sky is just the foundation.\r\n\r\nThat’s certainly positive. On a final note and as you’re somewhat in the transition process, what would you say to people considering a similar move?\r\nYou need to know before you go. Do not just make hasty decisions. I see a lot of people you’ve interviewed on the MoveBackToNigeria.com website who’ve successfully made the move back home are either in the finance sector or the engineering sector and that’s understandable as those sectors are currently enjoying a boom. It is not the same for the health sector and anyone who does not do sufficient research will most likely encounter problems. Doctors are not doing so well back home except those who run their own clinics.\r\n\r\nAnother point to remember is that you need to be open-minded and not compare Nigerian systems to those in the west.

(2) – Prof.Soludo', 'The former Central Bank governor, Prof. Charles Soludo in a recent forum organised by Nigeria Association of Industrial Pharmacists (NAIP) in Lagos, has questioned the ability of Nigeria’s manufacturing and pharmaceutical industry to compete in the global market with certain indices pointing to that direction.\r\n\r\nAs I review the global industry, the structural shifts and market trends, I do not have good news for the audience here. I refer specifically to the pharmaceutical manufacturers among your membership. As of today, Nigeria has neither a comparative nor a competitive advantage in pharmaceuticals.\r\n\r\n(To deliberately create a competitive advantage will require serious strategizing and effort). On cost considerations, Nigerian firms cannot compete: the risk-adjusted rate of return on investment in the industry is comparatively very low. It is not surprising that the global majors in the industry are not pouring in capital. Estimated at about US$l,billion (less than 0.5% of Nigeria’s GDP and basically the size of a medium-sized pharmaceutical company abroad) the share of Nigeria’s, pharmaceutical industry in the global industry is basically zero.\r\n\r\nLocal manufacfure has been consistently losing market shares in the local market let alone being competitive in the international market. I understand that todate, none of the pharmaceutical companies in Nigeria is WHO- certified. If you adjust for the outsourced production to foreign firms, the 100 or so largely small and fragmented companies in the industry account for about 20% of domestic drug consumption.\r\n\r\nIt is a struggling industry. Some of the existing firms have resorted to a number of ‘survivalist strategies’ by joining the ‘trading train – as marketers for foreign firms or have outsourced their production to Indian and Chinese manufacturers while, they are more amply rewarded as happy importers. I will not be surprised if out of your 300 corporate members, more than 60% are in the marketing/distribution segment.\r\n\r\nI will not waste your time with a rehearsal of why and how the industry is not competitive. You probably have a better list of the reasons. The bottomline is that it is subject to the same competitive disadvantages as the productive sector especially manufacturing.\r\n\r\nThe industry cannot withstand the drug armada from China and India in particular – which have by far better cost advantages – and you cannot stop them from coming given our obligations under the General Agreement on Trade and Tariffs (GATT) and the World Trade Organization (WTO). Some of you complain that the industry is a victim of unfair trade (characterized by inflow of fake, illegal, substandard drugs or even ‘dumping’) while the government does little to ‘protect’ or patronize the industry.\r\n\r\nSome demand for special, cheaper funds for pharmaceuticals production. The list is long. I will argue that some of the proposals, if implemented, will merely act as short to medium term palliatives. In your language, administering only pain killers to a patient with malaria will not make him well.\r\n\r\nWhere do we go from here?\r\n\r\nSome analysts believe that the national development discourse is saddled with creeping analysis paralysis.\r\n\r\nPhilosophers, it is said, have interpreted the world: the problem is to change it! As I review the National Economic Empowerment and Development Strategy – NEEDS – or its revised version in the name of Vision 2020 document, the various ‘conclusions’ of the annual Nigerian Economic Summit, and the sundry ‘blueprints’ f1ying around you almost come to the conclusion that the missing link is a focused execution capacity.\r\n', 15, '2013-09-26 09:53:39', 0, NULL, NULL),
(10, 'Appraising Nigeria’s need for a pharmaceutical intervention fund', '\r\nAppraising Nigeria’s need for a pharmaceutical intervention fund\r\n\r\non December 17, 2012   /   in Viewpoint 8:16 pm   /   Comments\r\n\r\nBY YANGE IKYAA\r\n\r\nACCORDING to a research conducted on 90 drugs approved by US regulators between 1998 and 2000, the results of more than half of all clinical trials which demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of new drugs are not published within five years of the drugs in the market.\r\n\r\nThe researchers, who traced the publication or otherwise of 909 separate clinical trials in scientific literature, wrote that the failure of drug companies to publish evidences relating to new medicines amounted to “scientific misconduct,” harming public good and preventing informed decisions by doctors and patients on the safe use of new medicines.\r\n\r\nHowever, to most people in many lands, the United States is a nation that stands at the apex of consumer safety and effective drug market regulation in comparison with other nations throughout the world. But the contrary reality by these research findings may hold critical lessons for Nigeria and other countries with strong dependence and increased public confidence in foreign medical supplies for the day to day management of domestic healthcare problems.\r\n\r\nFor instance, when a call was made in April 2012 by NAFDAC that a 200 billion naira Pharmaceutical Intervention Fund be established in Nigeria, the idea was viewed by many people as financially expensive. According to official statements, the proposed Fund would be used in\r\nfinancing loans to local pharmaceutical firms in order to enhance their capacity for more production or possible expansion. Yet, the idea received some resentment from a section of the Nigerian masses.\r\n\r\nBut this critical report by American researchers may become a strong reason for most of them to now reconsider their respective positions on the matter, particularly as the nations on which Nigeria depends for health safety are being linked with consumer risks and other regulatory challenges.\r\n\r\nOn July 26, 2000, the Journal of the American Medical Association (Vol. 284, No. 4) reported that, every day, 290 people are killed by prescription drugs approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration, FDA. The report was authored by Dr. Barbara Starfield (MD, MPH) of the Johns Hopkins School of Hygiene and Public Health, who also placed the annual figure for deaths from the adverse effects of FDA-approved prescription medications at 106, 000 people.\r\n\r\nWith this manner of scary statistics from reputable medical sources, the regulation of consumer imports in Nigeria deserves to be treated as an urgent matter of national security. In order to achieve this, there must be a clearly laid_out plan to increase local production of pharmaceutical goods and enhance proportional reduction in the amount of imported medical supplies.\r\n\r\nAlready, there are favourable conditions for achieving this, but the Nigerian government seems to be going slow in this direction. Recently, the World Health Organization, WHO, certified Pan African Foundation, PAF, as a potential beneficiary of the NAFDAC-proposed Fund.  PAF is a Nigerian disposable syringe manufacturing company based in Port Harcourt, and was one among 11 other companies selected by NAFDAC for the WHO prequalification exercise. The company won a place alongside more others in South Africa, Uganda and Morocco, thus completing a list of seven companies endorsed by experts from US and the European Union.\r\n\r\nIn technical terms, a pre_qualification by WHO gives pharmaceutical companies the franchise of marketing their products worldwide. If PAF succeeds to function this way, it will not only strengthen the nation’s arm of consumer safety but also boost its revenue base.\r\n\r\nHowever, without a swift reaction to the NAFDAC-proposed Fund, Nigeria may only be sitting on her prospects in the sustainable management of its healthcare sector.\r\n\r\n*Mr.  Ikyaa, a commentator on national issues, wrote from Abuja.', 15, '2013-09-26 09:53:39', 0, NULL, NULL),
(11, '\r\nAppraising Nigeria’s need for a pharmaceutical intervention fund', 'Mr. Lolu Ojo, Chief Executive Officer of Merit HealthCare Limited and Chairman of the Nigerian Association of Industrial Pharmacists (NAIP) in this interview with BEN NDUBUWA spoke on the need for government to help the pharmaceutical industry grow through  patronage as well as putting in place policies to check the incidence of fake drugs.\r\n\r\nWhat are the challenges facing the pharmaceutical industry?\r\n\r\nThe challenges of the pharmaceutical industry in Nigeria are myriad just like every other sector of the economy. First we do not have a conducive environment to operate in. The truth is that the environment is hostile to business growth and development. However, we are determined and we have charged our people to rise above the harsh economic environment.  We believe that as the day goes by, we will survive and give thanks to God.\r\n\r\nWhat more can you say in an environment where you generate your own electricity, build your borehole for water, pay for security, build your roads and drainage, among others. For instance, in the past one month or so, we had no light because some vandals stole the cable from the transformer. So, everyday, we run the generator to keep the business going. For me this is one of the greatest challenges.\r\n\r\nAgain, as you are probably aware, 70 per cent of all the pharmaceutical products consumed in this country are actually imported. Therefore, any swing in the foreign exchange rate directly impact on our businesses. If, for instance, you had made an order for some products and there is a change in the exchange rate that is not favourable you will be in trouble. This is an economy where you cannot increase price arbitrarily because the customer is already complaining of the old price not being affordable.\r\n\r\n The upward swing in exchange rate, which had been our lot in the past few years, erodes our margin and limit our ability to expand, upgrade facilities, employ more people, take risks/higher challenges, etc. More so, banks’ interest rate is not better. It is the most unfriendly compared to what happens in other climes. We pay as much as 25 per cent or more.  The high cost of production is quite challenging.\r\n\r\nSome of our colleagues, including myself, are into importation not necessarily because we want to but more because it offers a more convenient platform to start business. I would have preferred to be in manufacturing and we have decided that, no matter what it is going to cost, we will start our own production soon. The fear all over the place is that of inadequate power supply. For instance, if your production line is busy producing and all of a sudden the power goes off and assuming my generator is faulty, the worst that will happen to me as an importer is the inconveniences of not being able to use the computer systems or the office, but, it is not the same for a manufacturer. The loss would be enormous.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nAs chairman of NAIP, what do you intend to achieve?\r\n\r\nNAIP is a technical arm of the Pharmaceutical Society of Nigeria (PSN). The members of NAIP are those pharmacists who are not in the hospitals, community pharmacy practice, or in the academia. We have a lot of pharmacists in the banks, in telecommunications, in the oil industry and other areas.  \r\n\r\n As a group, we are stronger and able to speak with bigger and louder voice and we can mobilise our members and engage in those things that will favour them. As a body, whether you are manufacturing, marketing or other forms of industrial pharmacy, the important thing is that we come together instead of having a cacophony of voices. That way, we have resemblance of orderliness and one voice.\r\n\r\nJust recently, we had a stakeholders’ meeting to streamline the process of handling product complaints. Not only that, just like any other association, we can call ourselves to order and we can call companies to order as well. If pharmacists that are working with companies and are not doing well, we call them to order. We have handled so many cases like that. We also work on development, For instance, we have set up a business academy called ‘NAIP Business Academy’.\r\n\r\nIt is a training institution and the objective is to fill the skill and knowledge gaps that we have observed in the industry. When we started as sales representative, we were trained for up to three to four months. This is hardly the case now. So, it has become imperative that the Association should set up such an institution for our members.\r\n\r\nIt is unfortunate the some multinationals that we take pleasure in condemning are the ones that took extra time to train us before allowing us to go to the field. This institution is to take care of this gap created by the exit of some of these companies.  Unfortunately, the multinationals left because of the difficult operating environment. The Pfizer, Bayer, Roche, etc, they all left Nigeria then, though they are coming back but not as big as they were before their exit. Most of them now have a simple marketing office in the country.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nWhat Is attracting the multinationals back?\r\n\r\nYou cannot ignore Nigeria. The whole world is looking towards Nigeria as the next place for investment. Do you know what is happening in America and Europe now? Africa and Nigeria is surely the next destination for investment. You cannot ignore 160 million people. I learnt about the assertion of the CEO of Shoprite if as it is being widely circulated that 60 percent of Nigerians are living below poverty level, the remaining 40 percent that are probably above the poverty line is more than the population of South Africa.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nHow is your relationship with NAFDAC?         \r\n\r\nOur relationship with NAFDAC is normal but not optimal. I sincerely hope that before the end of my tenure as the national chairman of NAIP, the relationship will get better. I had actually led a delegation of NAIP members to the DG of NAFDAC’s office to declare our support and readiness to work with the agency. As a gentle man, he is good; his intentions are genuine and altruistic. There is need for more contact.\r\n\r\n A delegation of PSN recently met the DG and it was agreed that we need to interact more irrespective our differences for the good of the nation. Unfortunately, I could not attend that meeting because of other pressing and earlier scheduled NAIP assignment. We need to discuss and agree on issues and interventions in a free atmosphere before execution. Some issues or interventions like anti-faking devices, etc need the support of everybody for success.\r\n\r\nNAFDAC is a regulating institution and not a ‘strangulator’. The pharmaceutical industry form more than 80 per cent of NAFDAC’s clientele base. Therefore, we need each other for the sector to be vibrant. It is to our interest for a regulatory body like NAFDAC to be vibrant and alive to her responsibilities.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nHow do you feel about fake drugs coming from Asian countries?    \r\n\r\nUntil we change our attitude it will continue. The people bringing in fake drugs are Nigerians. Whether it is Musa, Okechukwu, Laolu or Ekaitte the thing is that they are Nigerians. There is nothing wrong with India or China. All the products you see on the shelves in Europe and America are from China and India; these drugs are made there because the cost of production is low. It is our people that go to tell these people don’t worry instead of 250 mg make it 50mg and label it 250mg and ship it to me I will sell them. What we tell our people is that they should buy from the right source.', 5, '2013-09-26 08:22:52', 1, NULL, NULL),

(13, 'PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY IN NIGERIA IS FACING TOUGH TIME', 'Nnamdi Okafor\r\nThis may not be the best of times for the pharmaceutical industry in the country as the sector is still grappling with tough challenges that simply refuse to go away after many concerted efforts. According to Mr Nnamdi Okafor, the CEO, May & Baker Plc, the problems, which range from intense competition, low capacity utilization, serious faking and adulteration of original brands and even low buying power of customers, have been giving the industry a reputation of low profitability and return on investment.\r\n\r\nBut how does he intend to go through with these problems as the new helmsman of a 67-year-old healthcare institution?\r\n\r\n''I have my ideas on where I want to take the company which is also in tandem with the corporate vision.

Okafor said at an interactive session with media men, his first ever since assuming office, where he bared it all on his roadmap to take the company to its promised land. To him, the strength of any company is a reflection of the strength of its brands. ''So we intend to increase our support for our brands. We recognize that May & Baker is a strong brand and we shall continue to build on that strength'', he added.\r\n\r\nOkafor, a fellow of the Pharmaceutical Society of Nigeria(PSN) and the Nigerian Institute of Management (NIM) and an alumnus of the Lagos Business School, has been with May & Baker since 1985. He became the managing director of May & Baker Nigeria Plc on February 1, 2011 following the appointment of his predecessor, Dr Joseph Odumodu, as the Director-General of the Standards Organisation of Nigeria (SON).\r\n\r\nHe holds a Bachelor of Pharmacy degree from the then University of Ife, Ile-Ife (now Obafemi Awolowo University, Ife) as well as Master of Business Administration (MBA) in Marketing from ESUT Business School, Lagos. Commenting on the appointment of his former boss as SON Director General, he was full of praises for the man who put the company on a good pedestal for the 13 years.\r\n\r\nHis words: ''I want to put it on record that I inherited a good company.

So we are standing on a solid ground and are very proud of what he accomplished.''\r\n\r\nThis solid ground he promised to build on to make it a greater height by turning May & Baker to one of the fastest growing and profitable businesses in its category. ''This we intend to accomplish by developing a strategic mindset, putting our business on a rapid, stable and sustainable growth path, building systems and processes that function seamlessly and developing appetite for stretch financial goals. We are already working on a new strategic plan which will form the new road map for our journey towards our vision.''\r\n\r\nIn this piece, he shed more light on how he intends to achieve this lofty ideals.\r\n\r\nExcerpts:\r\nBackground\r\nI became the managing director of May & Baker Nigeria Plc on February 1, 2011. As you are aware, the transition became necessary when our immediate past managing director, Dr Joseph Odumodu, was appointed the Director-General of the Standards Organisation of Nigeria (SON) by the President. I am not new to the May & Baker family, having spent the 25 years of my working life in the company. If anything, I can say with every sense of modesty that I am indeed on a familiar terrain having also been on the board of this company as executive director for the past eight years.\r\n\r\nMy participation in the management of this company over these years has given me good knowledge of the business and will help me avoid past mistakes in trying to chart a new course for the company. However, it has its potential pitfall which is a tendency to perpetrate status quo. I can however assure you that the latter will not be the case here.\r\n\r\nThis is because the first thing I did on assumption of this new role is to reset my clock to my first day at work in May & Baker. This is to enable me see opportunities for change. It is clear to me that the only way to move this business to a new level is by implementing change through injection of new ideas and ways of doing things. So we will implement change. But we shall not implement change for the sake of change, we will only implement changes that will enhance our processes, business results and ultimately shareholder value.\r\n\r\nVision\r\nI want to put it on record the fact that I inherited a good company. Our former managing director did a fantastic job in his 22 years of service to this company, 13 of which were spent at the helm of affairs. He navigated this company through its most turbulent years and put it on a sound pedestal with impressive revenue and profit growth, robust asset base and strong corporate reputation. So we are standing on a solid ground and are very proud of what he accomplished.\r\n\r\nOn this note, permit me to give you an outline of my vision for the company and the strategic direction of the new management. May and Baker has a corporate vision which is ''To Be Among the Top 10 Conglomerates in Nigeria by 2020''. That vision remains unchanged because we believe it is the best we can have at this time. It was the collective decision of the management team taken at a strategic retreat three years ago and we shall vigorously pursue this dream.\r\n\r\nHowever, I have my ideas on where I want to take the company which is also in tandem with the corporate vision. We want to take this good company that has been handed over to us and turn it into a great company. A truly strong and stable world-class company powered by strong global brands, aggressive business diversification, optimum business process efficiency and good corporate governance principles.\r\n\r\nTo me the strength of a company is a reflection of the strength of its brands. So we intend to increase our support for our brands.\r\n\r\nWe recognize that May & Baker is a strong brand and we shall continue to build on that strength. However we also recognize that this equity is only strong with the older generation. Therefore we will deliberately target the younger generation with products and corporate social responsibility initiatives that will appeal to their lifestyle. Our strategic intent is to make May & Baker one of the fastest growing and profitable businesses in it''s category.\r\n\r\nThis we intend to accomplish by; developing a strategic mindset, putting our business on a rapid, stable and sustainable growth path, building systems and processes that function seamlessly and developing appetite for stretch financial goals. We are already working on a new strategic plan which will form the new road map for our journey towards our vision. This plan will be unveiled in the next three months and guide all our subsequent investments and resource deployment.\r\n\r\nCSR\r\nIn May & Baker we have supported the society through various sponsorships and donations to individuals, professional groups, governmental and non-governmental bodies. We intend to move a step further by being a credible source of information on public health and safety education, awareness and disease prevention. To achieve these objectives we are interested in partnering with societies and groups that invest in social wellbeing\r\n\r\nNew plant\r\nAs some of you are aware, May & Baker started a new pharmaceutical plant in Ota in 2008. It is a world class plant designed to blaze the trail in Nigeria as the country''s first WHO pre-Qualified pharmaceutical facility. This feat is meant to be not only a corporate accomplishment but also a national achievement. With it, Nigeria will be recording another first in West and Central Africa because the plant would be the first of its kind in these sub-regions. When fully certified by the WHO, the pharma plant in Ota will open a gateway to international business as well as help conserve the country''s foreign exchange in the area of drugs. This facility will be open to both local and international drug procuring entities who currently buy from Western and Asian manufacturers.\r\n\r\nThe facility, which has taken investment in excess of N3 billion, is now near completion and will have a capacity of about 30 billion tablets and 25 million bottles per annum working only two eight-hour shifts per day. This, in addition to our current capacities at the Ikeja factory, will represent a significant percentage of Nigeria''s drug requirement. The successful take-off of this plant in a short time is a major objective of the new management. In the years ahead we shall remain focused while playing on high stakes. We have plans to take full advantage of new openings in the economy and shall vigorously pursue opportunities in the export business especially within the West African sub region under the common external tariff programme of ECOWAS.\r\n\r\nWHO certification\r\nWe are not the only company in Nigeria that is going for the World Health Organization (WHO) certification . But I believe that we have the best chance of getting it because we have the best chance of getting it because we have the best facility. The process of getting WHO certification is a long process. It takes up to 18 months. It is a long process of documentation and it is also a political process. We are working very hard to get it in record time and I want to also say that NAFDAC is doing a very good job in this area by trying to assist companies which are ready to collaborate with WHO. We are going to Geneva next month(April) for a workshop meant to open up an avenue where drug manufacturers would interact with WHO officials who are in charge of this process.\r\n\r\nThat will facilitate the time frame for achieving it.\r\n\r\nChallenges\r\nYou know, the new plant is a very massive project. And I would say that we underestimated what would be involved. And as the project gets towards completion stage, we have challenges. So we have challenges with some of our contractors who started appealing for reviews and reviews. And at some point, we could not continue to grant such requests. So we have to change the main contractor who was working on the project. And in doing so, we lost some months-about two or three months. But I want to reassure you that that factory will start test running by the end of this month (March). We should be ready to start running on some products by the end of this month. And before the end of half year, we should officially commission that facility.\r\n\r\nThe year 2011 promises to be a very uncertain year for business generally. The reasons among others include the April general elections, adverse weather conditions in Asia and impact on food prices, revolution in the Middle East and impact on crude oil supply and prices and the overall impact of all these on inflation and purchasing power of an average Nigerian. As you are all aware, the pharmaceutical industry has been challenged over the years by various issues ranging from intense competition, low capacity utilization, serious faking and adulteration of original brands and even low buying power of customers.\r\n\r\nThis has given the industry a reputation of low profitability and return on investment. However at May and Baker Nigeria PLC, rather than being deterred by these negative signals, we have decided to drive our business and have performed above industry average. Our key strategies for higher performance in 2011 include stronger support for our brands especially our foods brand Mimee Noodles, broadening of our products offering and expected increase in output following commissioning of our Ota plant.\r\n\r\nWe are embarking on various expansion projects to deliver an enviable company for all. What we promise the shareholders is that we shall continue to make their investments in our company worthwhile by ensuring that they enjoy the benefits accruable from a strong entity in terms of returns on investment, capital appreciation and security of investment. We intend to excite our shareholders with more robust dividends.\r\n\r\nProducts\r\nCrunch Mee is still in the market but I must say it is not doing as much as we have wanted. The reason is that consumers seem not to like the way it is presented. People want it to be in form that would be easier for them to manage. At some point, we had to change its flavour and in that way improve its acceptability. We are in the process of reformulating it. But for it to get to the level that we want , the form will have to change and that will also involve some capital expenses. And because we are struggling to finish the one that we are doing, we are not in a hurry to put in money in buying machines for now. Mimee too is not out of the market.\r\n\r\nWe are very much in the market. Mimee is also not operating at 100 per cent capacity. We still have some spare capacity. What is happening is that that industry has full capacity. Some people came in, Dangote came in, Flourmills came in, Honeywell has been there. So we have a lot of capacity. In fact, Dangote built three factories and as I talk to you now, only one is functioning. The other two are down because the operators in the industry, unfortunately, are not expanding demand at the pace in which capacity was going up. There is some tough competition going on. That is why we have decided to, on our own, do something about demand. Very soon, we are going to be breaking our new campaign. And that campaign, I believe, is meant to sensitise the consumers and to get more people to try Mimee.\r\n\r\nAdulteration\r\nI am aware that some 10 years ago, this was a very bad situation because it was being done on two fronts: One, people were doing their own here and some were going outside Nigeria to also adulterate or fake these products. NAFDAC has done a lot to stem the tide. I would say that the incidence of adulteration has significantly come down. However, we still have issues of products being faked from time to time. I know we have encountered some of our products that were faked outside the country and brought in. And what we did was to quickly get in touch with NAFDAC.\r\n\r\nAnd working with NAFDAC, we were able to round up some of the parties that were involved in it because it was a very big cartel. What we have to do was trying to apply the break to whatever they had done and possibly confiscate the items. But beyond that, the legal system is a bit difficult to go through and we were not being prepared to go the whole hog of trying to imprison the people behind these things. But we just want to keep them uncomfortable and ensure that we dissuade them from continuing.\r\n\r\nOn the issue of faking, if you have followed the trend of the fakers, you will find out that they are evolving. One of the initiatives that we have also subscribed to is the use of identification code for the products. A lot of the products that can easily be faked would have some codes that people can pick up, and send SMS to a particular number and then get confirmation whether such product is genuine or not. As I said, the fakers are evolving, this is technology. For now, I am not sure they have been able to beat that particular system. So we are adopting it. And we keep looking at better ways to handle such situation.\r\n\r\nLiabilities\r\nIt is true that when you inherit assets, you also inherit liabilities. We know the environment that we are operating in and we know that everything is not rosy. And as business, we have liabilities. Of course, the first one is the fact that we need to build stronger brand as a company because that would help us to weather the storm, I mean when there is shock and withstand that shock in the system. If you have very strong brand, you will be able to withstand it.\r\n\r\nOf course, the fact that we are building a factory and we are borrowing money, we will also be paying interest on these funds. And what that means is that it would put some pressure on cash to run the business. That is one area that I am looking at with the Finance Director. That is what I can say for now. We will continue to improve on the good job that the past MD did. And there is always room for improvement.\r\n\r\nFuture plan\r\nWe are set to intensify our drive for rapid business expansion and diversification. We have already concluded plans to deepen our activities in current markets and enter new markets with new exciting products through parent and subsidiary companies. We are also at the verge of expanding our activities into new geographic markets including aggressive Inroads into export markets. We have in place established processes, procedures, policies and control systems that have guided our operations. Notwithstanding that these systems are working satisfactorily, we intend to look at some of them again with a view to making them more efficient. So we intend to continually fine tune our systems, processes and procedures for higher efficiency and better results.\r\n\r\nOur work force remains our most valuable assets. We are proud to have a rare assemblage of highly qualified and dedicated staff. This is made possible because May & Baker has a highly transparent recruitment process that ensures that only people who demonstrate the right competencies, mental and psychological disposition are employed. We shall provide the right environment and training for these talents to blossom into world class work force. We intend to adopt best practices in corporate governance. We shall run the business with the highest level of integrity and compliance with all relevant laws and regulations.\r\n\r\nAdvice\r\nOne thing that I want to say is that we are lucky as a country that we are exporting crude oil. So when the price of this crude oil goes up in the international market, and now that the Niger Delta situation is a bit under control, what this means is that we are going to export more crude; we are going to earn more revenue. The only thing that I would like to request is that the way this money is utilized will make a whole lot of difference.\r\n\r\nAs against what happens now, I mean the sharing of the money among the states and nobody can really accounts for what comes out of the extra windfall, the Federal Government should try to use this money to improve on infrastructure. Because a lot of people in the country are doing nothing because there is no power. For instance , imagine that we have 24 hours power supply, a lot of people will be working and also generate income for themselves. And that would reduce the difficulties that people are facing. It is important that government applies whatever resources(at its disposal) well.\r\n\r\nAnd like what is happening in some countries, food is very critical. The Federal Government should continue with what they are doing, which is subsidizing inputs of agriculture, which is important. And if it is possible, like it is being done in other parts of the world, subsidise some critical commodities like flour. The cost of flour has gone up and Nigerians like bread a lot. This means that they have to pay more for it. I think that the government should step in for such important items to see how the cost can be put under control.

(15, 'Prospect for Nigeria’s pharmaceutical industry ', 'The health needs of a nation reflect on certain essential medicines consumed by the populace. With the determining factor in the pharmaceutical business dependent on increasing disease pattern, over-the-counter (OTC) medicines such as analgesics, antimalarials and multivitamins make up a large share of the Nigerian market. Painkillers, also known as analgesics or antipyretics, have the largest market share of therapeutic classes of medicines locally produced due to their affordability, availability and widespread use for a wide range of symptoms.\r\n\r\nThis revelation, contained in a recent document review of the nation’s pharmaceutical sector tagged “Global United Nations Industrial Development Organisation (UNIDO) Project”, shows that analgesics constitute 25 percent of drugs produced in the country. Others include antibiotics (15 percent), multivitamins + haematinics (15 percent), antimalarial medicines (14 percent), antihypertensives (8 percent), cough and cold preparations (5 percent), antiretroviral medicines (6 percent), external/topical preparations (5 percent), antiTB medicines (4 percent), and others (3 percent).\r\n\r\nThe report shows that the existing large market size, strong demand and the need for management of infectious diseases, especially HIV/AIDS, malaria, TB, and neglected childhood diseases constitute enormous opportunity for pharmaceutical firms to produce therapeutic drugs to meet the health needs of Nigerians.\r\n\r\nCurrently, Nigeria is responsible for about 60 percent of medicines consumed in the ECOWAS by volume, underlining the huge sub-regional market of an estimated 600 million people, according to Pharmaceutical Manufacturing Group, Manufacturers’ Association of Nigeria (PMG-MAN). Trade incentives introduced by ECOWAS for pharmaceuticals within West Africa are helping to promote movement of pharmaceuticals within the sub-region, experts believe. Furthermore, the West African Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association (WAPMA) is working to enhance confidence in the quality of medicines produced locally and promote business in the sub-region.\r\n\r\nEstimates of the size of the nation’s pharmaceutical market vary. Business Monitor International (BMI) in 2009 estimated Nigeria’s pharmaceutical market at $600 million. Out of this figure, BMI attributes the largest share of $418 million to generic medicines, $121 million to OTC products, and $61 million to patented products.\r\n\r\nEqually, Frost & Sullivan, a growing partnership company, estimated a pharmaceutical market value of $740 million in 2009. Out of this figure, $266.4 million was attributed to generic medicines, $177.6 million to branded products, and $296 million to OTC products.\r\n\r\nDrug manufacturers in the country are faced with several constraints, including low capacity utilisation, under-capitalisation, a weak financial base, high production costs, as well as difficulty in meeting WHO prequalification criteria.\r\n\r\nHowever, with some pharmaceutical firms such as Evans, SWIPHA, CHI Pharmaceuticals, May and Baker, and Fidson Healthcare plc in the process of upgrading and/or building new facilities in preparation to meet these prequalification requirements, we believe this development will promote local production, given the increased opportunity to participate in international tenders, such as WHO, United Nations Children Fund (UNICEF), United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), UNITAID and the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, TB and Malaria. No doubt, WHO prequalification will help the nation to become self-sufficient in the manufacture of essential medicines, which will invariably have multiplier effects on the economy with creation of thousands of jobs and more foreign exchange earnings for the country.\r\n\r\nNigeria can learn from the India experience. The emergence of India’s pharmaceutical industry on the global landscape as a strong generics player allowed only process patents in pharmaceutical products. This development kept the cost of medicines at affordable levels by enabling domestic pharmaceutical firms to build technical expertise in reverse engineering of existing medicines by modifying the manufacturing process, thereby becoming efficient producers of generic drugs.', 9, '2013-09-26 08:22:57', 1, NULL, NULL),

The aim is to encourage young and not-so-young professionals in the diaspora who are trying to make the decision of whether to move back to Nigeria. In collaboration with the brilliant team at MoveBackToNigeria.com, we hope to bring you a weekly interview with individuals who have successfully made the leap. The idea is to share their successes and their challenges as they made the decision.\r\n\r\nA lot of Nigerians in the diaspora have questions about making a change at home in Nigeria. Many suggest really good ideas on how to make things better; others would like to contribute to making a difference back home but are just not sure where to begin.\r\n\r\nThis week, we excitedly bring you a feature on a young Nigerian pharmacist (he  has chosen to remain anonymous) who is moving back to Nigeria to pursue his dreams in the health sector and beyond. Read on, to hear him talk about his career so far, his hopes and plans for his pharmaceutical practice and his take on the pharmaceutical industry in Nigeria. We hope you enjoy reading his story.\r\n\r\nThanks for agreeing to speak to us. Could you kindly tell us who you are?\r\nI’m a young Nigerian pharmacist, living and working in London, England and looking to move back to Nigeria in the next few months. My interests range from sports to music and everything in between.\r\n\r\nWhen did you leave Nigeria and why?\r\nI left Nigeria for the UK in 2001 for educational reasons.\r\n\r\nCan you shed some light on these educational reasons?\r\nSure. I left Nigeria after secondary school to do my A Levels in the UK and subsequently attend university there as well.  I studied pharmacy at Cardiff University and graduated with a Masters in Pharmacy.\r\n\r\nDid you always know you wanted to be a pharmacist?\r\nNot necessarily. Whilst I was proficient in science subjects, I was not always sure of what science I wanted to practice. My dad then decided on pharmacy and I’m happy to say it’s turned out to be a worthy decision.\r\n\r\nThat’s certainly fortunate. So how did your career in pharmacy begin?\r\nWell, it’s a seemingly convoluted path so do bear with me as I narrate. In the UK, after studying pharmacy, there’s a 1 year mandatory ‘pre-registration’ program (similar to the housemanship in medicine) which involves 1 year of working, shadowing a pharmacist and a very challenging professional exam afterwards. I undertook mine at Tesco Pharmacy, thankfully passed the exams and then registered as a pharmacist in the UK. I then went back to Cardiff University for another Masters degree, this time in Strategic Marketing as I felt that my business skills were lacking and I needed to remedy that. This I did for long term reasons because, I knew I would one day be going back to Nigeria to set up a pharmacy and I wanted to have the entrepreneurial skills necessary to market my drugs. After this degree, I got a job at Superdrug which lasted only briefly as the visa rules got changed and so I had to prematurely leave the UK for Nigeria.\r\n\r\nAlthough I was somewhat disillusioned at the prospect, I decided to use the opportunity to undertake the NYSC program. However, when I got home, I realised that I was misinformed about the NYSC procedure, particularly as it applies to graduates of medicine and pharmacy. You have to register as a pharmacist and then take a 6week course which is rotated nationwide and runs once annually, before being eligible for NYSC. I had unfortunately arrived months before the course and did not relish the prospect of waiting idly which led me to decide to come back to the UK for a third Masters degree, this time in Global Affairs at the University of Buckingham. I did this alongside a part-time pharmacist job in Boots and I stayed with them, even after the completion of my course while planning another move back to Nigeria; this time much more thought out and researched. After Boots, a better opportunity presented itself at Sainsbury’s Pharmacy and I took it and that’s where I currently work as the pharmacy manager.\r\n\r\nYou’ve mentioned a few times, your unwavering intent to return to Nigeria. Why this mindset?\r\nMoving back to Nigeria should be a decision based on personal circumstances. After all is said and done and despite the very well documented infrastructural and societal challenges in Nigeria, there’s still nowhere like home. I have a very good job in the UK and live a comfortable life but I feel that going home now is the right thing to do, for me.  I would like to be closer to my family, most of whom reside there and I would also like to set up my pharmacy practice in Nigeria, God willing. It is where I want to be and where I am happiest.\r\n\r\nWhilst I’m there, the intent is to get some hands on work experience, register my company and prepare for NYSC. Another reason is that there is a huge influx of pharmacists into the UK and so the money is not even what it used to be. The sector here is also getting very saturated for instance, because of EU laws, pharmacists from eastern Europe can come to the UK, shadow a pharmacist for a month and then get their license irrespective of whatever sort of training (or not) they may received in their home countries.\r\n\r\nThat’s understandable. You have discussed setting up your Pharmacy in Nigeria, can you go into some detail and tell us what this would entail?\r\nMy background in pharmacy and business has prepared me for this and it is something I want to do for a myriad of reasons. Operating a small, retail pharmacy is a profitable venture, it is also one that by its very nature will meet a very basic human need as I plan to site it close to schools, hospitals and potentially also specialise in certain medication(s), be a distributor, supplying private and public establishments and much more. I’m very optimistic about moving back and while I am very aware that things don’t always turn out as planned, particularly in the uncertain Nigerian terrain, I’m just hoping for the best.\r\n\r\nThis naturally leads us to the pharmaceutical industry in Nigeria and bodies like PCN & NAFDAC. What are your thoughts regarding these regulatory bodies?\r\nThe pharmaceutical industry in Nigeria is definitely progressing.  However, I feel we need to start manufacturing more medicines in Nigeria. The obvious infrastructural challenges certainly pose obstacles to this but it’s an area that should be better explored. We need more companies like Emzor, Orange Drugs and so on as a lot of medicines are currently imported from India and China which is not the route I would personally take if given the opportunity. There is more that can be done to increase our production especially considering we have the raw materials in abundance and a good example of this is maize starch which is a major component of most medicines.\r\n\r\nThe regulatory agencies like NAFDAC (National Agency for Food & Drug Administration and Control) and PCN (Pharmacists Council of Nigeria) need to be empowered and constitutionalized so as to be more effective and also to eliminate the crippling bureaucracy.  There are existing policies which go a long way towards curbing illegal practices. Many people are not aware of the existing industry rules and this is due to the fact that they are hardly enforced. One such rule is one in which if a businessman wants to set up a pharmacy, there must an in-house pharmacist who must own at least 40% of the business so as to ensure best practice. The PCN also needs to organise more public enlightenment campaigns for citizens to be aware of the laws and policies. For instance medication like Valium and Lexotan by law are prescription only in Nigeria but a lot of people flout these stipulations.\r\n\r\nWhat unique opportunities exist in the industry for people who may also be considering a move back?\r\nThere are many opportunities that abound, just take the size of Nigeria into consideration. There are 36 states in Nigeria with each one presenting a unique opportunity to whoever is interested and with the wherewithal to power the interest. For instance, I know someone who lives in Delta State but chooses to travel to the neighbouring Edo State to purchase medication for her kids when the need arises. There might be pharmacies close to her but she chooses to go all the way and it may be a function of the origin of the drugs sold by the pharmacies. She may just prefer European brands such as GSK or Roche to the Asian brands which are what abound in Nigeria and so here exists an opportunity for a business venture. Also, the WHO states that the fake drugs market In Africa is worth millions of dollars and we have a lot of people coming in from neighbouring countries like Ghana and Cameroon to buy medicines in Nigeria and so this is another opportunity to come in and present an ethical and alternative change.\r\n\r\nThis is all very enlightening and you’re clearly very passionate about this cause. Where then, do you see yourself and potentially, your pharmacy in 3 to 5 years?\r\nHopefully in a stable and successful position.  I intend to eventually expand and open more branches of my pharmacy as well as be a key player in the sector. I have already started the legwork and so with hard work and God’s blessings, the sky is just the foundation.\r\n\r\nThat’s certainly positive. On a final note and as you’re somewhat in the transition process, what would you say to people considering a similar move?\r\nYou need to know before you go. Do not just make hasty decisions. I see a lot of people you’ve interviewed on the MoveBackToNigeria.com website who’ve successfully made the move back home are either in the finance sector or the engineering sector and that’s understandable as those sectors are currently enjoying a boom. It is not the same for the health sector and anyone who does not do sufficient research will most likely encounter problems. Doctors are not doing so well back home except those who run their own clinics.\r\n\r\nAnother point to remember is that you need to be open-minded and not compare Nigerian systems to those in the west. It’s also important to be patient and hardworking and eventually, things should pay off.\r\n\r\n Thank you very much for your time and best wishes moving forward.', 4, '2013-09-26 09:53:39', 0, NULL, NULL),
(25, '\r\nCan Nigeria’s manufacturing, pharmaceutical industry compete? (2) – Prof.Soludo', 'The former Central Bank governor, Prof. Charles Soludo in a recent forum organised by Nigeria Association of Industrial Pharmacists (NAIP) in Lagos, has questioned the ability of Nigeria’s manufacturing and pharmaceutical industry to compete in the global market with certain indices pointing to that direction.\r\n\r\nAs I review the global industry, the structural shifts and market trends, I do not have good news for the audience here. I refer specifically to the pharmaceutical manufacturers among your membership. As of today, Nigeria has neither a comparative nor a competitive advantage in pharmaceuticals.\r\n\r\n(To deliberately create a competitive advantage will require serious strategizing and effort). On cost considerations, Nigerian firms cannot compete: the risk-adjusted rate of return on investment in the industry is comparatively very low. It is not surprising that the global majors in the industry are not pouring in capital. Estimated at about US$l,billion (less than 0.5% of Nigeria’s GDP and basically the size of a medium-sized pharmaceutical company abroad) the share of Nigeria’s, pharmaceutical industry in the global industry is basically zero.\r\n\r\nLocal manufacfure has been consistently losing market shares in the local market let alone being competitive in the international market. I understand that todate, none of the pharmaceutical companies in Nigeria is WHO- certified. If you adjust for the outsourced production to foreign firms, the 100 or so largely small and fragmented companies in the industry account for about 20% of domestic drug consumption.\r\n\r\nIt is a struggling industry. Some of the existing firms have resorted to a number of ‘survivalist strategies’ by joining the ‘trading train – as marketers for foreign firms or have outsourced their production to Indian and Chinese manufacturers while, they are more amply rewarded as happy importers. I will not be surprised if out of your 300 corporate members, more than 60% are in the marketing/distribution segment.\r\n\r\nI will not waste your time with a rehearsal of why and how the industry is not competitive. You probably have a better list of the reasons. The bottomline is that it is subject to the same competitive disadvantages as the productive sector especially manufacturing.\r\n\r\nThe industry cannot withstand the drug armada from China and India in particular – which have by far better cost advantages – and you cannot stop them from coming given our obligations under the General Agreement on Trade and Tariffs (GATT) and the World Trade Organization (WTO). Some of you complain that the industry is a victim of unfair trade (characterized by inflow of fake, illegal, substandard drugs or even ‘dumping’) while the government does little to ‘protect’ or patronize the industry.\r\n\r\nSome demand for special, cheaper funds for pharmaceuticals production. The list is long. I will argue that some of the proposals, if implemented, will merely act as short to medium term palliatives. In your language, administering only pain killers to a patient with malaria will not make him well.\r\n\r\nWhere do we go from here?\r\n\r\nSome analysts believe that the national development discourse is saddled with creeping analysis paralysis.\r\n\r\nPhilosophers, it is said, have interpreted the world: the problem is to change it! As I review the National Economic Empowerment and Development Strategy – NEEDS – or its revised version in the name of Vision 2020 document, the various ‘conclusions’ of the annual Nigerian Economic Summit, and the sundry ‘blueprints’ f1ying around you almost come to the conclusion that the missing link is a focused execution capacity.\r\n', 15, '2013-09-26 09:53:39', 0, NULL, NULL),

But the contrary reality by these research findings may hold critical lessons for Nigeria and other countries with strong dependence and increased public confidence in foreign medical supplies for the day to day management of domestic healthcare problems.\r\n\r\nFor instance, when a call was made in April 2012 by NAFDAC that a 200 billion naira Pharmaceutical Intervention Fund be established in Nigeria, the idea was viewed by many people as financially expensive. According to official statements, the proposed Fund would be used in\r\nfinancing loans to local pharmaceutical firms in order to enhance their capacity for more production or possible expansion. Yet, the idea received some resentment from a section of the Nigerian masses.\r\n\r\nBut this critical report by American researchers may become a strong reason for most of them to now reconsider their respective positions on the matter, particularly as the nations on which Nigeria depends for health safety are being linked with consumer risks and other regulatory challenges.\r\n\r\nOn July 26, 2000, the Journal of the American Medical Association (Vol. 284, No. 4) reported that, every day, 290 people are killed by prescription drugs approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration, FDA. The report was authored by Dr. Barbara Starfield (MD, MPH) of the Johns Hopkins School of Hygiene and Public Health, who also placed the annual figure for deaths from the adverse effects of FDA-approved prescription medications at 106, 000 people.\r\n\r\nWith this manner of scary statistics from reputable medical sources, the regulation of consumer imports in Nigeria deserves to be treated as an urgent matter of national security. In order to achieve this, there must be a clearly laid_out plan to increase local production of pharmaceutical goods and enhance proportional reduction in the amount of imported medical supplies.\r\n\r\nAlready, there are favourable conditions for achieving this, but the Nigerian government seems to be going slow in this direction. Recently, the World Health Organization, WHO, certified Pan African Foundation, PAF, as a potential beneficiary of the NAFDAC-proposed Fund.  PAF is a Nigerian disposable syringe manufacturing company based in Port Harcourt, and was one among 11 other companies selected by NAFDAC for the WHO prequalification exercise. The company won a place alongside more others in South Africa, Uganda and Morocco, thus completing a list of seven companies endorsed by experts from US and the European Union.\r\n\r\nIn technical terms, a pre_qualification by WHO gives pharmaceutical companies the franchise of marketing their products worldwide. If PAF succeeds to function this way, it will not only strengthen the nation’s arm of consumer safety but also boost its revenue base.\r\n\r\nHowever, without a swift reaction to the NAFDAC-proposed Fund, Nigeria may only be sitting on her prospects in the sustainable management of its healthcare sector.\r\n\r\n*Mr.  Ikyaa, a commentator on national issues, wrote from Abuja.', 15, '2013-09-26 09:53:39', 0, NULL, NULL);

(27, '\r\nAppraising Nigeria’s need for a pharmaceutical intervention fund', 'Mr. Lolu Ojo, Chief Executive Officer of Merit HealthCare Limited and Chairman of the Nigerian Association of Industrial Pharmacists (NAIP) in this interview with BEN NDUBUWA spoke on the need for government to help the pharmaceutical industry grow through  patronage as well as putting in place policies to check the incidence of fake drugs.\r\n\r\nWhat are the challenges facing the pharmaceutical industry?\r\n\r\nThe challenges of the pharmaceutical industry in Nigeria are myriad just like every other sector of the economy. First we do not have a conducive environment to operate in. The truth is that the environment is hostile to business growth and development. However, we are determined and we have charged our people to rise above the harsh economic environment.  We believe that as the day goes by, we will survive and give thanks to God.\r\n\r\nWhat more can you say in an environment where you generate your own electricity, build your borehole for water, pay for security, build your roads and drainage, among others. For instance, in the past one month or so, we had no light because some vandals stole the cable from the transformer. So, everyday, we run the generator to keep the business going. For me this is one of the greatest challenges.\r\n\r\nAgain, as you are probably aware, 70 per cent of all the pharmaceutical products consumed in this country are actually imported. Therefore, any swing in the foreign exchange rate directly impact on our businesses. If, for instance, you had made an order for some products and there is a change in the exchange rate that is not favourable you will be in trouble. This is an economy where you cannot increase price arbitrarily because the customer is already complaining of the old price not being affordable.\r\n\r\n The upward swing in exchange rate, which had been our lot in the past few years, erodes our margin and limit our ability to expand, upgrade facilities, employ more people, take risks/higher challenges, etc. More so, banks’ interest rate is not better. It is the most unfriendly compared to what happens in other climes. We pay as much as 25 per cent or more.  The high cost of production is quite challenging.\r\n\r\nSome of our colleagues, including myself, are into importation not necessarily because we want to but more because it offers a more convenient platform to start business. I would have preferred to be in manufacturing and we have decided that, no matter what it is going to cost, we will start our own production soon. The fear all over the place is that of inadequate power supply. For instance, if your production line is busy producing and all of a sudden the power goes off and assuming my generator is faulty, the worst that will happen to me as an importer is the inconveniences of not being able to use the computer systems or the office, but, it is not the same for a manufacturer. The loss would be enormous.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nAs chairman of NAIP, what do you intend to achieve?\r\n\r\nNAIP is a technical arm of the Pharmaceutical Society of Nigeria (PSN). The members of NAIP are those pharmacists who are not in the hospitals, community pharmacy practice, or in the academia. We have a lot of pharmacists in the banks, in telecommunications, in the oil industry and other areas.  \r\n\r\n As a group, we are stronger and able to speak with bigger and louder voice and we can mobilise our members and engage in those things that will favour them. As a body, whether you are manufacturing, marketing or other forms of industrial pharmacy, the important thing is that we come together instead of having a cacophony of voices. That way, we have resemblance of orderliness and one voice.\r\n\r\nJust recently, we had a stakeholders’ meeting to streamline the process of handling product complaints. Not only that, just like any other association, we can call ourselves to order and we can call companies to order as well. If pharmacists that are working with companies and are not doing well, we call them to order. We have handled so many cases like that. We also work on development, For instance, we have set up a business academy called ‘NAIP Business Academy’.\r\n\r\nIt is a training institution and the objective is to fill the skill and knowledge gaps that we have observed in the industry. When we started as sales representative, we were trained for up to three to four months. This is hardly the case now. So, it has become imperative that the Association should set up such an institution for our members.\r\n\r\nIt is unfortunate the some multinationals that we take pleasure in condemning are the ones that took extra time to train us before allowing us to go to the field. This institution is to take care of this gap created by the exit of some of these companies.  Unfortunately, the multinationals left because of the difficult operating environment. The Pfizer, Bayer, Roche, etc, they all left Nigeria then, though they are coming back but not as big as they were before their exit. Most of them now have a simple marketing office in the country.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nWhat Is attracting the multinationals back?\r\n\r\nYou cannot ignore Nigeria. The whole world is looking towards Nigeria as the next place for investment. Do you know what is happening in America and Europe now? Africa and Nigeria is surely the next destination for investment. You cannot ignore 160 million people. I learnt about the assertion of the CEO of Shoprite if as it is being widely circulated that 60 percent of Nigerians are living below poverty level, the remaining 40 percent that are probably above the poverty line is more than the population of South Africa.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nHow is your relationship with NAFDAC?         \r\n\r\nOur relationship with NAFDAC is normal but not optimal. I sincerely hope that before the end of my tenure as the national chairman of NAIP, the relationship will get better. I had actually led a delegation of NAIP members to the DG of NAFDAC’s office to declare our support and readiness to work with the agency. As a gentle man, he is good; his intentions are genuine and altruistic. There is need for more contact.\r\n\r\n A delegation of PSN recently met the DG and it was agreed that we need to interact more irrespective our differences for the good of the nation. Unfortunately, I could not attend that meeting because of other pressing and earlier scheduled NAIP assignment. We need to discuss and agree on issues and interventions in a free atmosphere before execution. Some issues or interventions like anti-faking devices, etc need the support of everybody for success.\r\n\r\nNAFDAC is a regulating institution and not a ‘strangulator’. The pharmaceutical industry form more than 80 per cent of NAFDAC’s clientele base. Therefore, we need each other for the sector to be vibrant. It is to our interest for a regulatory body like NAFDAC to be vibrant and alive to her responsibilities.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nHow do you feel about fake drugs coming from Asian countries?    \r\n\r\nUntil we change our attitude it will continue. The people bringing in fake drugs are Nigerians. Whether it is Musa, Okechukwu, Laolu or Ekaitte the thing is that they are Nigerians. There is nothing wrong with India or China. All the products you see on the shelves in Europe and America are from China and India; these drugs are made there because the cost of production is low. It is our people that go to tell these people don’t worry instead of 250 mg make it 50mg and label it 250mg and ship it to me I will sell them. What we tell our people is that they should buy from the right source.', 5, '2013-09-26 09:53:39', 0, NULL, NULL),

(29, 'PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY IN NIGERIA IS FACING TOUGH TIME', 'Nnamdi Okafor\r\nThis may not be the best of times for the pharmaceutical industry in the country as the sector is still grappling with tough challenges that simply refuse to go away after many concerted efforts. According to Mr Nnamdi Okafor, the CEO, May & Baker Plc, the problems, which range from intense competition, low capacity utilization, serious faking and adulteration of original brands and even low buying power of customers, have been giving the industry a reputation of low profitability and return on investment.\r\n\r\nBut how does he intend to go through with these problems as the new helmsman of a 67-year-old healthcare institution?\r\n\r\n''I have my ideas on where I want to take the company which is also in tandem with the corporate vision.

Okafor said at an interactive session with media men, his first ever since assuming office, where he bared it all on his roadmap to take the company to its promised land. To him, the strength of any company is a reflection of the strength of its brands. ''So we intend to increase our support for our brands. We recognize that May & Baker is a strong brand and we shall continue to build on that strength'', he added.\r\n\r\nOkafor, a fellow of the Pharmaceutical Society of Nigeria(PSN) and the Nigerian Institute of Management (NIM) and an alumnus of the Lagos Business School, has been with May & Baker since 1985. He became the managing director of May & Baker Nigeria Plc on February 1, 2011 following the appointment of his predecessor, Dr Joseph Odumodu, as the Director-General of the Standards Organisation of Nigeria (SON).\r\n\r\nHe holds a Bachelor of Pharmacy degree from the then University of Ife, Ile-Ife (now Obafemi Awolowo University, Ife) as well as Master of Business Administration (MBA) in Marketing from ESUT Business School, Lagos. Commenting on the appointment of his former boss as SON Director General, he was full of praises for the man who put the company on a good pedestal for the 13 years.\r\n\r\nHis words: ''I want to put it on record that I inherited a good company.

''This we intend to accomplish by developing a strategic mindset, putting our business on a rapid, stable and sustainable growth path, building systems and processes that function seamlessly and developing appetite for stretch financial goals. We are already working on a new strategic plan which will form the new road map for our journey towards our vision.''\r\n\r\nIn this piece, he shed more light on how he intends to achieve this lofty ideals.\r\n\r\nExcerpts:\r\nBackground\r\nI became the managing director of May & Baker Nigeria Plc on February 1, 2011. As you are aware, the transition became necessary when our immediate past managing director, Dr Joseph Odumodu, was appointed the Director-General of the Standards Organisation of Nigeria (SON) by the President. I am not new to the May & Baker family, having spent the 25 years of my working life in the company. If anything, I can say with every sense of modesty that I am indeed on a familiar terrain having also been on the board of this company as executive director for the past eight years.\r\n\r\nMy participation in the management of this company over these years has given me good knowledge of the business and will help me avoid past mistakes in trying to chart a new course for the company. However, it has its potential pitfall which is a tendency to perpetrate status quo. I can however assure you that the latter will not be the case here.\r\n\r\nThis is because the first thing I did on assumption of this new role is to reset my clock to my first day at work in May & Baker. This is to enable me see opportunities for change. It is clear to me that the only way to move this business to a new level is by implementing change through injection of new ideas and ways of doing things. So we will implement change. But we shall not implement change for the sake of change, we will only implement changes that will enhance our processes, business results and ultimately shareholder value.\r\n\r\nVision\r\nI want to put it on record the fact that I inherited a good company. Our former managing director did a fantastic job in his 22 years of service to this company, 13 of which were spent at the helm of affairs. He navigated this company through its most turbulent years and put it on a sound pedestal with impressive revenue and profit growth, robust asset base and strong corporate reputation. So we are standing on a solid ground and are very proud of what he accomplished.\r\n\r\nOn this note, permit me to give you an outline of my vision for the company and the strategic direction of the new management. May and Baker has a corporate vision which is ''To Be Among the Top 10 Conglomerates in Nigeria by 2020''. That vision remains unchanged because we believe it is the best we can have at this time. It was the collective decision of the management team taken at a strategic retreat three years ago and we shall vigorously pursue this dream.\r\n\r\nHowever, I have my ideas on where I want to take the company which is also in tandem with the corporate vision. We want to take this good company that has been handed over to us and turn it into a great company. A truly strong and stable world-class company powered by strong global brands, aggressive business diversification, optimum business process efficiency and good corporate governance principles.\r\n\r\nTo me the strength of a company is a reflection of the strength of its brands. So we intend to increase our support for our brands.\r\n\r\nWe recognize that May & Baker is a strong brand and we shall continue to build on that strength. However we also recognize that this equity is only strong with the older generation. Therefore we will deliberately target the younger generation with products and corporate social responsibility initiatives that will appeal to their lifestyle. Our strategic intent is to make May & Baker one of the fastest growing and profitable businesses in it''s category.\r\n\r\nThis we intend to accomplish by; developing a strategic mindset, putting our business on a rapid, stable and sustainable growth path, building systems and processes that function seamlessly and developing appetite for stretch financial goals. We are already working on a new strategic plan which will form the new road map for our journey towards our vision. This plan will be unveiled in the next three months and guide all our subsequent investments and resource deployment.\r\n\r\nCSR\r\nIn May & Baker we have supported the society through various sponsorships and donations to individuals, professional groups, governmental and non-governmental bodies. We intend to move a step further by being a credible source of information on public health and safety education, awareness and disease prevention. To achieve these objectives we are interested in partnering with societies and groups that invest in social wellbeing\r\n\r\nNew plant\r\nAs some of you are aware, May & Baker started a new pharmaceutical plant in Ota in 2008. It is a world class plant designed to blaze the trail in Nigeria as the country''s first WHO pre-Qualified pharmaceutical facility. This feat is meant to be not only a corporate accomplishment but also a national achievement. With it, Nigeria will be recording another first in West and Central Africa because the plant would be the first of its kind in these sub-regions. When fully certified by the WHO, the pharma plant in Ota will open a gateway to international business as well as help conserve the country''s foreign exchange in the area of drugs. This facility will be open to both local and international drug procuring entities who currently buy from Western and Asian manufacturers.\r\n\r\nThe facility, which has taken investment in excess of N3 billion, is now near completion and will have a capacity of about 30 billion tablets and 25 million bottles per annum working only two eight-hour shifts per day. This, in addition to our current capacities at the Ikeja factory, will represent a significant percentage of Nigeria''s drug requirement. The successful take-off of this plant in a short time is a major objective of the new management. In the years ahead we shall remain focused while playing on high stakes. We have plans to take full advantage of new openings in the economy and shall vigorously pursue opportunities in the export business especially within the West African sub region under the common external tariff programme of ECOWAS.\r\n\r\nWHO certification\r\nWe are not the only company in Nigeria that is going for the World Health Organization (WHO) certification . But I believe that we have the best chance of getting it because we have the best chance of getting it because we have the best facility. The process of getting WHO certification is a long process. It takes up to 18 months. It is a long process of documentation and it is also a political process. We are working very hard to get it in record time and I want to also say that NAFDAC is doing a very good job in this area by trying to assist companies which are ready to collaborate with WHO. We are going to Geneva next month(April) for a workshop meant to open up an avenue where drug manufacturers would interact with WHO officials who are in charge of this process.\r\n\r\nThat will facilitate the time frame for achieving it.\r\n\r\nChallenges\r\nYou know, the new plant is a very massive project. And I would say that we underestimated what would be involved. And as the project gets towards completion stage, we have challenges. So we have challenges with some of our contractors who started appealing for reviews and reviews. And at some point, we could not continue to grant such requests. So we have to change the main contractor who was working on the project. And in doing so, we lost some months-about two or three months. But I want to reassure you that that factory will start test running by the end of this month (March). We should be ready to start running on some products by the end of this month. And before the end of half year, we should officially commission that facility.\r\n\r\nThe year 2011 promises to be a very uncertain year for business generally. The reasons among others include the April general elections, adverse weather conditions in Asia and impact on food prices, revolution in the Middle East and impact on crude oil supply and prices and the overall impact of all these on inflation and purchasing power of an average Nigerian. As you are all aware, the pharmaceutical industry has been challenged over the years by various issues ranging from intense competition, low capacity utilization, serious faking and adulteration of original brands and even low buying power of customers.\r\n\r\nThis has given the industry a reputation of low profitability and return on investment. However at May and Baker Nigeria PLC, rather than being deterred by these negative signals, we have decided to drive our business and have performed above industry average. Our key strategies for higher performance in 2011 include stronger support for our brands especially our foods brand Mimee Noodles, broadening of our products offering and expected increase in output following commissioning of our Ota plant.\r\n\r\nWe are embarking on various expansion projects to deliver an enviable company for all. What we promise the shareholders is that we shall continue to make their investments in our company worthwhile by ensuring that they enjoy the benefits accruable from a strong entity in terms of returns on investment, capital appreciation and security of investment. We intend to excite our shareholders with more robust dividends.\r\n\r\nProducts\r\nCrunch Mee is still in the market but I must say it is not doing as much as we have wanted. The reason is that consumers seem not to like the way it is presented. People want it to be in form that would be easier for them to manage. At some point, we had to change its flavour and in that way improve its acceptability. We are in the process of reformulating it. But for it to get to the level that we want , the form will have to change and that will also involve some capital expenses. And because we are struggling to finish the one that we are doing, we are not in a hurry to put in money in buying machines for now. Mimee too is not out of the market.\r\n\r\nWe are very much in the market. Mimee is also not operating at 100 per cent capacity. We still have some spare capacity. What is happening is that that industry has full capacity. Some people came in, Dangote came in, Flourmills came in, Honeywell has been there. So we have a lot of capacity. In fact, Dangote built three factories and as I talk to you now, only one is functioning. The other two are down because the operators in the industry, unfortunately, are not expanding demand at the pace in which capacity was going up. There is some tough competition going on. That is why we have decided to, on our own, do something about demand. Very soon, we are going to be breaking our new campaign. And that campaign, I believe, is meant to sensitise the consumers and to get more people to try Mimee.\r\n\r\nAdulteration\r\nI am aware that some 10 years ago, this was a very bad situation because it was being done on two fronts: One, people were doing their own here and some were going outside Nigeria to also adulterate or fake these products. NAFDAC has done a lot to stem the tide. I would say that the incidence of adulteration has significantly come down. However, we still have issues of products being faked from time to time. I know we have encountered some of our products that were faked outside the country and brought in. And what we did was to quickly get in touch with NAFDAC.\r\n\r\nAnd working with NAFDAC, we were able to round up some of the parties that were involved in it because it was a very big cartel. What we have to do was trying to apply the break to whatever they had done and possibly confiscate the items. But beyond that, the legal system is a bit difficult to go through and we were not being prepared to go the whole hog of trying to imprison the people behind these things. But we just want to keep them uncomfortable and ensure that we dissuade them from continuing.\r\n\r\nOn the issue of faking, if you have followed the trend of the fakers, you will find out that they are evolving. One of the initiatives that we have also subscribed to is the use of identification code for the products. A lot of the products that can easily be faked would have some codes that people can pick up, and send SMS to a particular number and then get confirmation whether such product is genuine or not. As I said, the fakers are evolving, this is technology. For now, I am not sure they have been able to beat that particular system. So we are adopting it. And we keep looking at better ways to handle such situation.\r\n\r\nLiabilities\r\nIt is true that when you inherit assets, you also inherit liabilities. We know the environment that we are operating in and we know that everything is not rosy. And as business, we have liabilities. Of course, the first one is the fact that we need to build stronger brand as a company because that would help us to weather the storm, I mean when there is shock and withstand that shock in the system. If you have very strong brand, you will be able to withstand it.\r\n\r\nOf course, the fact that we are building a factory and we are borrowing money, we will also be paying interest on these funds. And what that means is that it would put some pressure on cash to run the business. That is one area that I am looking at with the Finance Director. That is what I can say for now. We will continue to improve on the good job that the past MD did. And there is always room for improvement.\r\n\r\nFuture plan\r\nWe are set to intensify our drive for rapid business expansion and diversification. We have already concluded plans to deepen our activities in current markets and enter new markets with new exciting products through parent and subsidiary companies. We are also at the verge of expanding our activities into new geographic markets including aggressive Inroads into export markets. We have in place established processes, procedures, policies and control systems that have guided our operations. Notwithstanding that these systems are working satisfactorily, we intend to look at some of them again with a view to making them more efficient. So we intend to continually fine tune our systems, processes and procedures for higher efficiency and better results.\r\n\r\nOur work force remains our most valuable assets. We are proud to have a rare assemblage of highly qualified and dedicated staff. This is made possible because May & Baker has a highly transparent recruitment process that ensures that only people who demonstrate the right competencies, mental and psychological disposition are employed. We shall provide the right environment and training for these talents to blossom into world class work force. We intend to adopt best practices in corporate governance. We shall run the business with the highest level of integrity and compliance with all relevant laws and regulations.\r\n\r\nAdvice\r\nOne thing that I want to say is that we are lucky as a country that we are exporting crude oil. So when the price of this crude oil goes up in the international market, and now that the Niger Delta situation is a bit under control, what this means is that we are going to export more crude; we are going to earn more revenue. The only thing that I would like to request is that the way this money is utilized will make a whole lot of difference.\r\n\r\nAs against what happens now, I mean the sharing of the money among the states and nobody can really accounts for what comes out of the extra windfall, the Federal Government should try to use this money to improve on infrastructure. Because a lot of people in the country are doing nothing because there is no power. For instance , imagine that we have 24 hours power supply, a lot of people will be working and also generate income for themselves. And that would reduce the difficulties that people are facing. It is important that government applies whatever resources(at its disposal) well.\r\n\r\nAnd like what is happening in some countries, food is very critical. The Federal Government should continue with what they are doing, which is subsidizing inputs of agriculture, which is important. And if it is possible, like it is being done in other parts of the world, subsidise some critical commodities like flour. The cost of flour has gone up and Nigerians like bread a lot. This means that they have to pay more for it. I think that the government should step in for such important items to see how the cost can be put under control.

(31, 'Prospect for Nigeria’s pharmaceutical industry ', 'The health needs of a nation reflect on certain essential medicines consumed by the populace. With the determining factor in the pharmaceutical business dependent on increasing disease pattern, over-the-counter (OTC) medicines such as analgesics, antimalarials and multivitamins make up a large share of the Nigerian market. Painkillers, also known as analgesics or antipyretics, have the largest market share of therapeutic classes of medicines locally produced due to their affordability, availability and widespread use for a wide range of symptoms.\r\n\r\nThis revelation, contained in a recent document review of the nation’s pharmaceutical sector tagged “Global United Nations Industrial Development Organisation (UNIDO) Project”, shows that analgesics constitute 25 percent of drugs produced in the country. Others include antibiotics (15 percent), multivitamins + haematinics (15 percent), antimalarial medicines (14 percent), antihypertensives (8 percent), cough and cold preparations (5 percent), antiretroviral medicines (6 percent), external/topical preparations (5 percent), antiTB medicines (4 percent), and others (3 percent).\r\n\r\nThe report shows that the existing large market size, strong demand and the need for management of infectious diseases, especially HIV/AIDS, malaria, TB, and neglected childhood diseases constitute enormous opportunity for pharmaceutical firms to produce therapeutic drugs to meet the health needs of Nigerians.\r\n\r\nCurrently, Nigeria is responsible for about 60 percent of medicines consumed in the ECOWAS by volume, underlining the huge sub-regional market of an estimated 600 million people, according to Pharmaceutical Manufacturing Group, Manufacturers’ Association of Nigeria (PMG-MAN). Trade incentives introduced by ECOWAS for pharmaceuticals within West Africa are helping to promote movement of pharmaceuticals within the sub-region, experts believe. Furthermore, the West African Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association (WAPMA) is working to enhance confidence in the quality of medicines produced locally and promote business in the sub-region.\r\n\r\nEstimates of the size of the nation’s pharmaceutical market vary. Business Monitor International (BMI) in 2009 estimated Nigeria’s pharmaceutical market at $600 million. Out of this figure, BMI attributes the largest share of $418 million to generic medicines, $121 million to OTC products, and $61 million to patented products.\r\n\r\nEqually, Frost & Sullivan, a growing partnership company, estimated a pharmaceutical market value of $740 million in 2009. Out of this figure, $266.4 million was attributed to generic medicines, $177.6 million to branded products, and $296 million to OTC products.\r\n\r\nDrug manufacturers in the country are faced with several constraints, including low capacity utilisation, under-capitalisation, a weak financial base, high production costs, as well as difficulty in meeting WHO prequalification criteria.\r\n\r\nHowever, with some pharmaceutical firms such as Evans, SWIPHA, CHI Pharmaceuticals, May and Baker, and Fidson Healthcare plc in the process of upgrading and/or building new facilities in preparation to meet these prequalification requirements, we believe this development will promote local production, given the increased opportunity to participate in international tenders, such as WHO, United Nations Children Fund (UNICEF), United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), UNITAID and the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, TB and Malaria. No doubt, WHO prequalification will help the nation to become self-sufficient in the manufacture of essential medicines, which will invariably have multiplier effects on the economy with creation of thousands of jobs and more foreign exchange earnings for the country.\r\n\r\nNigeria can learn from the India experience. The emergence of India’s pharmaceutical industry on the global landscape as a strong generics player allowed only process patents in pharmaceutical products. This development kept the cost of medicines at affordable levels by enabling domestic pharmaceutical firms to build technical expertise in reverse engineering of existing medicines by modifying the manufacturing process, thereby becoming efficient producers of generic drugs.', 9, '2013-09-26 09:53:39', 0, NULL, NULL),

With such funds, she explained, the Council could institutionalize the drugs distribution channels in the country.\r\n\r\n  “Another advantage we can derive from such funds is, we will now have more indigenous companies manufacturing what we consume. If indigenous companies are the ones manufacturing then we can do what is called marketing surveillance.

The aim is to encourage young and not-so-young professionals in the diaspora who are trying to make the decision of whether to move back to Nigeria. In collaboration with the brilliant team at MoveBackToNigeria.com, we hope to bring you a weekly interview with individuals who have successfully made the leap. The idea is to share their successes and their challenges as they made the decision.\r\n\r\nA lot of Nigerians in the diaspora have questions about making a change at home in Nigeria. Many suggest really good ideas on how to make things better; others would like to contribute to making a difference back home but are just not sure where to begin.\r\n\r\nThis week, we excitedly bring you a feature on a young Nigerian pharmacist (he  has chosen to remain anonymous) who is moving back to Nigeria to pursue his dreams in the health sector and beyond. Read on, to hear him talk about his career so far, his hopes and plans for his pharmaceutical practice and his take on the pharmaceutical industry in Nigeria. We hope you enjoy reading his story.\r\n\r\nThanks for agreeing to speak to us. Could you kindly tell us who you are?\r\nI’m a young Nigerian pharmacist, living and working in London, England and looking to move back to Nigeria in the next few months. My interests range from sports to music and everything in between.\r\n\r\nWhen did you leave Nigeria and why?\r\nI left Nigeria for the UK in 2001 for educational reasons.\r\n\r\nCan you shed some light on these educational reasons?\r\nSure. I left Nigeria after secondary school to do my A Levels in the UK and subsequently attend university there as well.  I studied pharmacy at Cardiff University and graduated with a Masters in Pharmacy.\r\n\r\nDid you always know you wanted to be a pharmacist?\r\nNot necessarily. Whilst I was proficient in science subjects, I was not always sure of what science I wanted to practice. My dad then decided on pharmacy and I’m happy to say it’s turned out to be a worthy decision.\r\n\r\nThat’s certainly fortunate. So how did your career in pharmacy begin?\r\nWell, it’s a seemingly convoluted path so do bear with me as I narrate. In the UK, after studying pharmacy, there’s a 1 year mandatory ‘pre-registration’ program (similar to the housemanship in medicine) which involves 1 year of working, shadowing a pharmacist and a very challenging professional exam afterwards. I undertook mine at Tesco Pharmacy, thankfully passed the exams and then registered as a pharmacist in the UK. I then went back to Cardiff University for another Masters degree, this time in Strategic Marketing as I felt that my business skills were lacking and I needed to remedy that. This I did for long term reasons because, I knew I would one day be going back to Nigeria to set up a pharmacy and I wanted to have the entrepreneurial skills necessary to market my drugs. After this degree, I got a job at Superdrug which lasted only briefly as the visa rules got changed and so I had to prematurely leave the UK for Nigeria.\r\n\r\nAlthough I was somewhat disillusioned at the prospect, I decided to use the opportunity to undertake the NYSC program. However, when I got home, I realised that I was misinformed about the NYSC procedure, particularly as it applies to graduates of medicine and pharmacy. You have to register as a pharmacist and then take a 6week course which is rotated nationwide and runs once annually, before being eligible for NYSC. I had unfortunately arrived months before the course and did not relish the prospect of waiting idly which led me to decide to come back to the UK for a third Masters degree, this time in Global Affairs at the University of Buckingham. I did this alongside a part-time pharmacist job in Boots and I stayed with them, even after the completion of my course while planning another move back to Nigeria; this time much more thought out and researched. After Boots, a better opportunity presented itself at Sainsbury’s Pharmacy and I took it and that’s where I currently work as the pharmacy manager.\r\n\r\nYou’ve mentioned a few times, your unwavering intent to return to Nigeria. Why this mindset?\r\nMoving back to Nigeria should be a decision based on personal circumstances. After all is said and done and despite the very well documented infrastructural and societal challenges in Nigeria, there’s still nowhere like home. I have a very good job in the UK and live a comfortable life but I feel that going home now is the right thing to do, for me.  I would like to be closer to my family, most of whom reside there and I would also like to set up my pharmacy practice in Nigeria, God willing. It is where I want to be and where I am happiest.\r\n\r\nWhilst I’m there, the intent is to get some hands on work experience, register my company and prepare for NYSC. Another reason is that there is a huge influx of pharmacists into the UK and so the money is not even what it used to be. The sector here is also getting very saturated for instance, because of EU laws, pharmacists from eastern Europe can come to the UK, shadow a pharmacist for a month and then get their license irrespective of whatever sort of training (or not) they may received in their home countries.\r\n\r\nThat’s understandable. You have discussed setting up your Pharmacy in Nigeria, can you go into some detail and tell us what this would entail?\r\nMy background in pharmacy and business has prepared me for this and it is something I want to do for a myriad of reasons. Operating a small, retail pharmacy is a profitable venture, it is also one that by its very nature will meet a very basic human need as I plan to site it close to schools, hospitals and potentially also specialise in certain medication(s), be a distributor, supplying private and public establishments and much more. I’m very optimistic about moving back and while I am very aware that things don’t always turn out as planned, particularly in the uncertain Nigerian terrain, I’m just hoping for the best.\r\n\r\nThis naturally leads us to the pharmaceutical industry in Nigeria and bodies like PCN & NAFDAC. What are your thoughts regarding these regulatory bodies?\r\nThe pharmaceutical industry in Nigeria is definitely progressing.  However, I feel we need to start manufacturing more medicines in Nigeria. The obvious infrastructural challenges certainly pose obstacles to this but it’s an area that should be better explored. We need more companies like Emzor, Orange Drugs and so on as a lot of medicines are currently imported from India and China which is not the route I would personally take if given the opportunity. There is more that can be done to increase our production especially considering we have the raw materials in abundance and a good example of this is maize starch which is a major component of most medicines.\r\n\r\nThe regulatory agencies like NAFDAC (National Agency for Food & Drug Administration and Control) and PCN (Pharmacists Council of Nigeria) need to be empowered and constitutionalized so as to be more effective and also to eliminate the crippling bureaucracy.  There are existing policies which go a long way towards curbing illegal practices. Many people are not aware of the existing industry rules and this is due to the fact that they are hardly enforced. One such rule is one in which if a businessman wants to set up a pharmacy, there must an in-house pharmacist who must own at least 40% of the business so as to ensure best practice. The PCN also needs to organise more public enlightenment campaigns for citizens to be aware of the laws and policies. For instance medication like Valium and Lexotan by law are prescription only in Nigeria but a lot of people flout these stipulations.\r\n\r\nWhat unique opportunities exist in the industry for people who may also be considering a move back?\r\nThere are many opportunities that abound, just take the size of Nigeria into consideration. There are 36 states in Nigeria with each one presenting a unique opportunity to whoever is interested and with the wherewithal to power the interest. For instance, I know someone who lives in Delta State but chooses to travel to the neighbouring Edo State to purchase medication for her kids when the need arises. There might be pharmacies close to her but she chooses to go all the way and it may be a function of the origin of the drugs sold by the pharmacies. She may just prefer European brands such as GSK or Roche to the Asian brands which are what abound in Nigeria and so here exists an opportunity for a business venture. Also, the WHO states that the fake drugs market In Africa is worth millions of dollars and we have a lot of people coming in from neighbouring countries like Ghana and Cameroon to buy medicines in Nigeria and so this is another opportunity to come in and present an ethical and alternative change.\r\n\r\nThis is all very enlightening and you’re clearly very passionate about this cause. Where then, do you see yourself and potentially, your pharmacy in 3 to 5 years?\r\nHopefully in a stable and successful position.  I intend to eventually expand and open more branches of my pharmacy as well as be a key player in the sector. I have already started the legwork and so with hard work and God’s blessings, the sky is just the foundation.\r\n\r\nThat’s certainly positive. On a final note and as you’re somewhat in the transition process, what would you say to people considering a similar move?\r\nYou need to know before you go. Do not just make hasty decisions. I see a lot of people you’ve interviewed on the MoveBackToNigeria.com website who’ve successfully made the move back home are either in the finance sector or the engineering sector and that’s understandable as those sectors are currently enjoying a boom. It is not the same for the health sector and anyone who does not do sufficient research will most likely encounter problems. Doctors are not doing so well back home except those who run their own clinics.\r\n\r\nAnother point to remember is that you need to be open-minded and not compare Nigerian systems to those in the west. It’s also important to be patient and hardworking and eventually, things should pay off.\r\n\r\n Thank you very much for your time and best wishes moving forward.', 4, '2013-09-26 09:53:39', 0, NULL, NULL),
(41, '\r\nCan Nigeria’s manufacturing, pharmaceutical industry compete? (2) – Prof.Soludo', 'The former Central Bank governor, Prof. Charles Soludo in a recent forum organised by Nigeria Association of Industrial Pharmacists (NAIP) in Lagos, has questioned the ability of Nigeria’s manufacturing and pharmaceutical industry to compete in the global market with certain indices pointing to that direction.\r\n\r\nAs I review the global industry, the structural shifts and market trends, I do not have good news for the audience here. I refer specifically to the pharmaceutical manufacturers among your membership. As of today, Nigeria has neither a comparative nor a competitive advantage in pharmaceuticals.\r\n\r\n(To deliberately create a competitive advantage will require serious strategizing and effort). On cost considerations, Nigerian firms cannot compete: the risk-adjusted rate of return on investment in the industry is comparatively very low. It is not surprising that the global majors in the industry are not pouring in capital. Estimated at about US$l,billion (less than 0.5% of Nigeria’s GDP and basically the size of a medium-sized pharmaceutical company abroad) the share of Nigeria’s, pharmaceutical industry in the global industry is basically zero.\r\n\r\nLocal manufacfure has been consistently losing market shares in the local market let alone being competitive in the international market. I understand that todate, none of the pharmaceutical companies in Nigeria is WHO- certified. If you adjust for the outsourced production to foreign firms, the 100 or so largely small and fragmented companies in the industry account for about 20% of domestic drug consumption.\r\n\r\nIt is a struggling industry. Some of the existing firms have resorted to a number of ‘survivalist strategies’ by joining the ‘trading train – as marketers for foreign firms or have outsourced their production to Indian and Chinese manufacturers while, they are more amply rewarded as happy importers. I will not be surprised if out of your 300 corporate members, more than 60% are in the marketing/distribution segment.\r\n\r\nI will not waste your time with a rehearsal of why and how the industry is not competitive. You probably have a better list of the reasons. The bottomline is that it is subject to the same competitive disadvantages as the productive sector especially manufacturing.\r\n\r\nThe industry cannot withstand the drug armada from China and India in particular – which have by far better cost advantages – and you cannot stop them from coming given our obligations under the General Agreement on Trade and Tariffs (GATT) and the World Trade Organization (WTO). Some of you complain that the industry is a victim of unfair trade (characterized by inflow of fake, illegal, substandard drugs or even ‘dumping’) while the government does little to ‘protect’ or patronize the industry.\r\n\r\nSome demand for special, cheaper funds for pharmaceuticals production. The list is long. I will argue that some of the proposals, if implemented, will merely act as short to medium term palliatives. In your language, administering only pain killers to a patient with malaria will not make him well.\r\n\r\nWhere do we go from here?\r\n\r\nSome analysts believe that the national development discourse is saddled with creeping analysis paralysis.\r\n\r\nPhilosophers, it is said, have interpreted the world: the problem is to change it! As I review the National Economic Empowerment and Development Strategy – NEEDS – or its revised version in the name of Vision 2020 document, the various ‘conclusions’ of the annual Nigerian Economic Summit, and the sundry ‘blueprints’ f1ying around you almost come to the conclusion that the missing link is a focused execution capacity.\r\n', 15, '2013-09-26 09:53:39', 0, NULL, NULL),

But the contrary reality by these research findings may hold critical lessons for Nigeria and other countries with strong dependence and increased public confidence in foreign medical supplies for the day to day management of domestic healthcare problems.\r\n\r\nFor instance, when a call was made in April 2012 by NAFDAC that a 200 billion naira Pharmaceutical Intervention Fund be established in Nigeria, the idea was viewed by many people as financially expensive. According to official statements, the proposed Fund would be used in\r\nfinancing loans to local pharmaceutical firms in order to enhance their capacity for more production or possible expansion. Yet, the idea received some resentment from a section of the Nigerian masses.\r\n\r\nBut this critical report by American researchers may become a strong reason for most of them to now reconsider their respective positions on the matter, particularly as the nations on which Nigeria depends for health safety are being linked with consumer risks and other regulatory challenges.\r\n\r\nOn July 26, 2000, the Journal of the American Medical Association (Vol. 284, No. 4) reported that, every day, 290 people are killed by prescription drugs approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration, FDA. The report was authored by Dr. Barbara Starfield (MD, MPH) of the Johns Hopkins School of Hygiene and Public Health, who also placed the annual figure for deaths from the adverse effects of FDA-approved prescription medications at 106, 000 people.\r\n\r\nWith this manner of scary statistics from reputable medical sources, the regulation of consumer imports in Nigeria deserves to be treated as an urgent matter of national security. In order to achieve this, there must be a clearly laid_out plan to increase local production of pharmaceutical goods and enhance proportional reduction in the amount of imported medical supplies.\r\n\r\nAlready, there are favourable conditions for achieving this, but the Nigerian government seems to be going slow in this direction. Recently, the World Health Organization, WHO, certified Pan African Foundation, PAF, as a potential beneficiary of the NAFDAC-proposed Fund.  PAF is a Nigerian disposable syringe manufacturing company based in Port Harcourt, and was one among 11 other companies selected by NAFDAC for the WHO prequalification exercise. The company won a place alongside more others in South Africa, Uganda and Morocco, thus completing a list of seven companies endorsed by experts from US and the European Union.\r\n\r\nIn technical terms, a pre_qualification by WHO gives pharmaceutical companies the franchise of marketing their products worldwide. If PAF succeeds to function this way, it will not only strengthen the nation’s arm of consumer safety but also boost its revenue base.\r\n\r\nHowever, without a swift reaction to the NAFDAC-proposed Fund, Nigeria may only be sitting on her prospects in the sustainable management of its healthcare sector.\r\n\r\n*Mr.  Ikyaa, a commentator on national issues, wrote from Abuja.', 15, '2013-09-26 09:53:39', 0, NULL, NULL),
(43, '\r\nAppraising Nigeria’s need for a pharmaceutical intervention fund', 'Mr. Lolu Ojo, Chief Executive Officer of Merit HealthCare Limited and Chairman of the Nigerian Association of Industrial Pharmacists (NAIP) in this interview with BEN NDUBUWA spoke on the need for government to help the pharmaceutical industry grow through  patronage as well as putting in place policies to check the incidence of fake drugs.\r\n\r\nWhat are the challenges facing the pharmaceutical industry?\r\n\r\nThe challenges of the pharmaceutical industry in Nigeria are myriad just like every other sector of the economy. First we do not have a conducive environment to operate in. The truth is that the environment is hostile to business growth and development. However, we are determined and we have charged our people to rise above the harsh economic environment.  We believe that as the day goes by, we will survive and give thanks to God.\r\n\r\nWhat more can you say in an environment where you generate your own electricity, build your borehole for water, pay for security, build your roads and drainage, among others. For instance, in the past one month or so, we had no light because some vandals stole the cable from the transformer. So, everyday, we run the generator to keep the business going. For me this is one of the greatest challenges.\r\n\r\nAgain, as you are probably aware, 70 per cent of all the pharmaceutical products consumed in this country are actually imported. Therefore, any swing in the foreign exchange rate directly impact on our businesses. If, for instance, you had made an order for some products and there is a change in the exchange rate that is not favourable you will be in trouble. This is an economy where you cannot increase price arbitrarily because the customer is already complaining of the old price not being affordable.\r\n\r\n The upward swing in exchange rate, which had been our lot in the past few years, erodes our margin and limit our ability to expand, upgrade facilities, employ more people, take risks/higher challenges, etc. More so, banks’ interest rate is not better. It is the most unfriendly compared to what happens in other climes. We pay as much as 25 per cent or more.  The high cost of production is quite challenging.\r\n\r\nSome of our colleagues, including myself, are into importation not necessarily because we want to but more because it offers a more convenient platform to start business. I would have preferred to be in manufacturing and we have decided that, no matter what it is going to cost, we will start our own production soon. The fear all over the place is that of inadequate power supply. For instance, if your production line is busy producing and all of a sudden the power goes off and assuming my generator is faulty, the worst that will happen to me as an importer is the inconveniences of not being able to use the computer systems or the office, but, it is not the same for a manufacturer. The loss would be enormous.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nAs chairman of NAIP, what do you intend to achieve?\r\n\r\nNAIP is a technical arm of the Pharmaceutical Society of Nigeria (PSN). The members of NAIP are those pharmacists who are not in the hospitals, community pharmacy practice, or in the academia. We have a lot of pharmacists in the banks, in telecommunications, in the oil industry and other areas.  \r\n\r\n As a group, we are stronger and able to speak with bigger and louder voice and we can mobilise our members and engage in those things that will favour them. As a body, whether you are manufacturing, marketing or other forms of industrial pharmacy, the important thing is that we come together instead of having a cacophony of voices. That way, we have resemblance of orderliness and one voice.\r\n\r\nJust recently, we had a stakeholders’ meeting to streamline the process of handling product complaints. Not only that, just like any other association, we can call ourselves to order and we can call companies to order as well. If pharmacists that are working with companies and are not doing well, we call them to order. We have handled so many cases like that. We also work on development, For instance, we have set up a business academy called ‘NAIP Business Academy’.\r\n\r\nIt is a training institution and the objective is to fill the skill and knowledge gaps that we have observed in the industry. When we started as sales representative, we were trained for up to three to four months. This is hardly the case now. So, it has become imperative that the Association should set up such an institution for our members.\r\n\r\nIt is unfortunate the some multinationals that we take pleasure in condemning are the ones that took extra time to train us before allowing us to go to the field. This institution is to take care of this gap created by the exit of some of these companies.  Unfortunately, the multinationals left because of the difficult operating environment. The Pfizer, Bayer, Roche, etc, they all left Nigeria then, though they are coming back but not as big as they were before their exit. Most of them now have a simple marketing office in the country.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nWhat Is attracting the multinationals back?\r\n\r\nYou cannot ignore Nigeria. The whole world is looking towards Nigeria as the next place for investment. Do you know what is happening in America and Europe now? Africa and Nigeria is surely the next destination for investment. You cannot ignore 160 million people. I learnt about the assertion of the CEO of Shoprite if as it is being widely circulated that 60 percent of Nigerians are living below poverty level, the remaining 40 percent that are probably above the poverty line is more than the population of South Africa.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nHow is your relationship with NAFDAC?         \r\n\r\nOur relationship with NAFDAC is normal but not optimal. I sincerely hope that before the end of my tenure as the national chairman of NAIP, the relationship will get better. I had actually led a delegation of NAIP members to the DG of NAFDAC’s office to declare our support and readiness to work with the agency. As a gentle man, he is good; his intentions are genuine and altruistic. There is need for more contact.\r\n\r\n A delegation of PSN recently met the DG and it was agreed that we need to interact more irrespective our differences for the good of the nation. Unfortunately, I could not attend that meeting because of other pressing and earlier scheduled NAIP assignment. We need to discuss and agree on issues and interventions in a free atmosphere before execution. Some issues or interventions like anti-faking devices, etc need the support of everybody for success.\r\n\r\nNAFDAC is a regulating institution and not a ‘strangulator’. The pharmaceutical industry form more than 80 per cent of NAFDAC’s clientele base. Therefore, we need each other for the sector to be vibrant. It is to our interest for a regulatory body like NAFDAC to be vibrant and alive to her responsibilities.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nHow do you feel about fake drugs coming from Asian countries?    \r\n\r\nUntil we change our attitude it will continue. The people bringing in fake drugs are Nigerians. Whether it is Musa, Okechukwu, Laolu or Ekaitte the thing is that they are Nigerians. There is nothing wrong with India or China. All the products you see on the shelves in Europe and America are from China and India; these drugs are made there because the cost of production is low. It is our people that go to tell these people don’t worry instead of 250 mg make it 50mg and label it 250mg and ship it to me I will sell them. What we tell our people is that they should buy from the right source.', 5, '2013-09-26 09:53:39', 0, NULL, NULL),

As you are aware, the transition became necessary when our immediate past managing director, Dr Joseph Odumodu, was appointed the Director-General of the Standards Organisation of Nigeria (SON) by the President. I am not new to the May & Baker family, having spent the 25 years of my working life in the company. If anything, I can say with every sense of modesty that I am indeed on a familiar terrain having also been on the board of this company as executive director for the past eight years.\r\n\r\nMy participation in the management of this company over these years has given me good knowledge of the business and will help me avoid past mistakes in trying to chart a new course for the company. However, it has its potential pitfall which is a tendency to perpetrate status quo. I can however assure you that the latter will not be the case here.\r\n\r\nThis is because the first thing I did on assumption of this new role is to reset my clock to my first day at work in May & Baker. This is to enable me see opportunities for change. It is clear to me that the only way to move this business to a new level is by implementing change through injection of new ideas and ways of doing things. So we will implement change. But we shall not implement change for the sake of change, we will only implement changes that will enhance our processes, business results and ultimately shareholder value.\r\n\r\nVision\r\nI want to put it on record the fact that I inherited a good company. Our former managing director did a fantastic job in his 22 years of service to this company, 13 of which were spent at the helm of affairs. He navigated this company through its most turbulent years and put it on a sound pedestal with impressive revenue and profit growth, robust asset base and strong corporate reputation. So we are standing on a solid ground and are very proud of what he accomplished.\r\n\r\nOn this note, permit me to give you an outline of my vision for the company and the strategic direction of the new management. May and Baker has a corporate vision which is ''To Be Among the Top 10 Conglomerates in Nigeria by 2020''. That vision remains unchanged because we believe it is the best we can have at this time. It was the collective decision of the management team taken at a strategic retreat three years ago and we shall vigorously pursue this dream.\r\n\r\nHowever, I have my ideas on where I want to take the company which is also in tandem with the corporate vision. We want to take this good company that has been handed over to us and turn it into a great company. A truly strong and stable world-class company powered by strong global brands, aggressive business diversification, optimum business process efficiency and good corporate governance principles.\r\n\r\nTo me the strength of a company is a reflection of the strength of its brands. So we intend to increase our support for our brands.\r\n\r\nWe recognize that May & Baker is a strong brand and we shall continue to build on that strength. However we also recognize that this equity is only strong with the older generation. Therefore we will deliberately target the younger generation with products and corporate social responsibility initiatives that will appeal to their lifestyle. Our strategic intent is to make May & Baker one of the fastest growing and profitable businesses in it''s category.\r\n\r\nThis we intend to accomplish by; developing a strategic mindset, putting our business on a rapid, stable and sustainable growth path, building systems and processes that function seamlessly and developing appetite for stretch financial goals. We are already working on a new strategic plan which will form the new road map for our journey towards our vision. This plan will be unveiled in the next three months and guide all our subsequent investments and resource deployment.\r\n\r\nCSR\r\nIn May & Baker we have supported the society through various sponsorships and donations to individuals, professional groups, governmental and non-governmental bodies. We intend to move a step further by being a credible source of information on public health and safety education, awareness and disease prevention. To achieve these objectives we are interested in partnering with societies and groups that invest in social wellbeing\r\n\r\nNew plant\r\nAs some of you are aware, May & Baker started a new pharmaceutical plant in Ota in 2008. It is a world class plant designed to blaze the trail in Nigeria as the country''s first WHO pre-Qualified pharmaceutical facility. This feat is meant to be not only a corporate accomplishment but also a national achievement. With it, Nigeria will be recording another first in West and Central Africa because the plant would be the first of its kind in these sub-regions. When fully certified by the WHO, the pharma plant in Ota will open a gateway to international business as well as help conserve the country''s foreign exchange in the area of drugs. This facility will be open to both local and international drug procuring entities who currently buy from Western and Asian manufacturers.\r\n\r\nThe facility, which has taken investment in excess of N3 billion, is now near completion and will have a capacity of about 30 billion tablets and 25 million bottles per annum working only two eight-hour shifts per day. This, in addition to our current capacities at the Ikeja factory, will represent a significant percentage of Nigeria''s drug requirement. The successful take-off of this plant in a short time is a major objective of the new management. In the years ahead we shall remain focused while playing on high stakes. We have plans to take full advantage of new openings in the economy and shall vigorously pursue opportunities in the export business especially within the West African sub region under the common external tariff programme of ECOWAS.\r\n\r\nWHO certification\r\nWe are not the only company in Nigeria that is going for the World Health Organization (WHO) certification . But I believe that we have the best chance of getting it because we have the best chance of getting it because we have the best facility. The process of getting WHO certification is a long process. It takes up to 18 months. It is a long process of documentation and it is also a political process. We are working very hard to get it in record time and I want to also say that NAFDAC is doing a very good job in this area by trying to assist companies which are ready to collaborate with WHO. We are going to Geneva next month(April) for a workshop meant to open up an avenue where drug manufacturers would interact with WHO officials who are in charge of this process.\r\n\r\nThat will facilitate the time frame for achieving it.\r\n\r\nChallenges\r\nYou know, the new plant is a very massive project. And I would say that we underestimated what would be involved. And as the project gets towards completion stage, we have challenges. So we have challenges with some of our contractors who started appealing for reviews and reviews. And at some point, we could not continue to grant such requests. So we have to change the main contractor who was working on the project. And in doing so, we lost some months-about two or three months. But I want to reassure you that that factory will start test running by the end of this month (March). We should be ready to start running on some products by the end of this month. And before the end of half year, we should officially commission that facility.\r\n\r\nThe year 2011 promises to be a very uncertain year for business generally. The reasons among others include the April general elections, adverse weather conditions in Asia and impact on food prices, revolution in the Middle East and impact on crude oil supply and prices and the overall impact of all these on inflation and purchasing power of an average Nigerian. As you are all aware, the pharmaceutical industry has been challenged over the years by various issues ranging from intense competition, low capacity utilization, serious faking and adulteration of original brands and even low buying power of customers.\r\n\r\nThis has given the industry a reputation of low profitability and return on investment. However at May and Baker Nigeria PLC, rather than being deterred by these negative signals, we have decided to drive our business and have performed above industry average. Our key strategies for higher performance in 2011 include stronger support for our brands especially our foods brand Mimee Noodles, broadening of our products offering and expected increase in output following commissioning of our Ota plant.\r\n\r\nWe are embarking on various expansion projects to deliver an enviable company for all. What we promise the shareholders is that we shall continue to make their investments in our company worthwhile by ensuring that they enjoy the benefits accruable from a strong entity in terms of returns on investment, capital appreciation and security of investment. We intend to excite our shareholders with more robust dividends.\r\n\r\nProducts\r\nCrunch Mee is still in the market but I must say it is not doing as much as we have wanted. The reason is that consumers seem not to like the way it is presented. People want it to be in form that would be easier for them to manage. At some point, we had to change its flavour and in that way improve its acceptability. We are in the process of reformulating it. But for it to get to the level that we want , the form will have to change and that will also involve some capital expenses. And because we are struggling to finish the one that we are doing, we are not in a hurry to put in money in buying machines for now. Mimee too is not out of the market.\r\n\r\nWe are very much in the market. Mimee is also not operating at 100 per cent capacity. We still have some spare capacity. What is happening is that that industry has full capacity. Some people came in, Dangote came in, Flourmills came in, Honeywell has been there. So we have a lot of capacity. In fact, Dangote built three factories and as I talk to you now, only one is functioning. The other two are down because the operators in the industry, unfortunately, are not expanding demand at the pace in which capacity was going up. There is some tough competition going on. That is why we have decided to, on our own, do something about demand. Very soon, we are going to be breaking our new campaign. And that campaign, I believe, is meant to sensitise the consumers and to get more people to try Mimee.\r\n\r\nAdulteration\r\nI am aware that some 10 years ago, this was a very bad situation because it was being done on two fronts: One, people were doing their own here and some were going outside Nigeria to also adulterate or fake these products. NAFDAC has done a lot to stem the tide. I would say that the incidence of adulteration has significantly come down. However, we still have issues of products being faked from time to time. I know we have encountered some of our products that were faked outside the country and brought in. And what we did was to quickly get in touch with NAFDAC.\r\n\r\nAnd working with NAFDAC, we were able to round up some of the parties that were involved in it because it was a very big cartel. What we have to do was trying to apply the break to whatever they had done and possibly confiscate the items. But beyond that, the legal system is a bit difficult to go through and we were not being prepared to go the whole hog of trying to imprison the people behind these things. But we just want to keep them uncomfortable and ensure that we dissuade them from continuing.\r\n\r\nOn the issue of faking, if you have followed the trend of the fakers, you will find out that they are evolving. One of the initiatives that we have also subscribed to is the use of identification code for the products. A lot of the products that can easily be faked would have some codes that people can pick up, and send SMS to a particular number and then get confirmation whether such product is genuine or not. As I said, the fakers are evolving, this is technology. For now, I am not sure they have been able to beat that particular system. So we are adopting it. And we keep looking at better ways to handle such situation.\r\n\r\nLiabilities\r\nIt is true that when you inherit assets, you also inherit liabilities. We know the environment that we are operating in and we know that everything is not rosy. And as business, we have liabilities. Of course, the first one is the fact that we need to build stronger brand as a company because that would help us to weather the storm, I mean when there is shock and withstand that shock in the system. If you have very strong brand, you will be able to withstand it.\r\n\r\nOf course, the fact that we are building a factory and we are borrowing money, we will also be paying interest on these funds. And what that means is that it would put some pressure on cash to run the business. That is one area that I am looking at with the Finance Director. That is what I can say for now. We will continue to improve on the good job that the past MD did. And there is always room for improvement.\r\n\r\nFuture plan\r\nWe are set to intensify our drive for rapid business expansion and diversification. We have already concluded plans to deepen our activities in current markets and enter new markets with new exciting products through parent and subsidiary companies. We are also at the verge of expanding our activities into new geographic markets including aggressive Inroads into export markets. We have in place established processes, procedures, policies and control systems that have guided our operations. Notwithstanding that these systems are working satisfactorily, we intend to look at some of them again with a view to making them more efficient. So we intend to continually fine tune our systems, processes and procedures for higher efficiency and better results.\r\n\r\nOur work force remains our most valuable assets. We are proud to have a rare assemblage of highly qualified and dedicated staff. This is made possible because May & Baker has a highly transparent recruitment process that ensures that only people who demonstrate the right competencies, mental and psychological disposition are employed. We shall provide the right environment and training for these talents to blossom into world class work force. We intend to adopt best practices in corporate governance. We shall run the business with the highest level of integrity and compliance with all relevant laws and regulations.\r\n\r\nAdvice\r\nOne thing that I want to say is that we are lucky as a country that we are exporting crude oil. So when the price of this crude oil goes up in the international market, and now that the Niger Delta situation is a bit under control, what this means is that we are going to export more crude; we are going to earn more revenue. The only thing that I would like to request is that the way this money is utilized will make a whole lot of difference.\r\n\r\nAs against what happens now, I mean the sharing of the money among the states and nobody can really accounts for what comes out of the extra windfall, the Federal Government should try to use this money to improve on infrastructure. Because a lot of people in the country are doing nothing because there is no power. For instance , imagine that we have 24 hours power supply, a lot of people will be working and also generate income for themselves. And that would reduce the difficulties that people are facing. It is important that government applies whatever resources(at its disposal) well.\r\n\r\nAnd like what is happening in some countries, food is very critical. The Federal Government should continue with what they are doing, which is subsidizing inputs of agriculture, which is important. And if it is possible, like it is being done in other parts of the world, subsidise some critical commodities like flour. The cost of flour has gone up and Nigerians like bread a lot. This means that they have to pay more for it. I think that the government should step in for such important items to see how the cost can be put under control.

(47, 'Prospect for Nigeria’s pharmaceutical industry ', 'The health needs of a nation reflect on certain essential medicines consumed by the populace. With the determining factor in the pharmaceutical business dependent on increasing disease pattern, over-the-counter (OTC) medicines such as analgesics, antimalarials and multivitamins make up a large share of the Nigerian market. Painkillers, also known as analgesics or antipyretics, have the largest market share of therapeutic classes of medicines locally produced due to their affordability, availability and widespread use for a wide range of symptoms.\r\n\r\nThis revelation, contained in a recent document review of the nation’s pharmaceutical sector tagged “Global United Nations Industrial Development Organisation (UNIDO) Project”, shows that analgesics constitute 25 percent of drugs produced in the country. Others include antibiotics (15 percent), multivitamins + haematinics (15 percent), antimalarial medicines (14 percent), antihypertensives (8 percent), cough and cold preparations (5 percent), antiretroviral medicines (6 percent), external/topical preparations (5 percent), antiTB medicines (4 percent), and others (3 percent).\r\n\r\nThe report shows that the existing large market size, strong demand and the need for management of infectious diseases, especially HIV/AIDS, malaria, TB, and neglected childhood diseases constitute enormous opportunity for pharmaceutical firms to produce therapeutic drugs to meet the health needs of Nigerians.\r\n\r\nCurrently, Nigeria is responsible for about 60 percent of medicines consumed in the ECOWAS by volume, underlining the huge sub-regional market of an estimated 600 million people, according to Pharmaceutical Manufacturing Group, Manufacturers’ Association of Nigeria (PMG-MAN). Trade incentives introduced by ECOWAS for pharmaceuticals within West Africa are helping to promote movement of pharmaceuticals within the sub-region, experts believe. Furthermore, the West African Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association (WAPMA) is working to enhance confidence in the quality of medicines produced locally and promote business in the sub-region.\r\n\r\nEstimates of the size of the nation’s pharmaceutical market vary. Business Monitor International (BMI) in 2009 estimated Nigeria’s pharmaceutical market at $600 million. Out of this figure, BMI attributes the largest share of $418 million to generic medicines, $121 million to OTC products, and $61 million to patented products.\r\n\r\nEqually, Frost & Sullivan, a growing partnership company, estimated a pharmaceutical market value of $740 million in 2009. Out of this figure, $266.4 million was attributed to generic medicines, $177.6 million to branded products, and $296 million to OTC products.\r\n\r\nDrug manufacturers in the country are faced with several constraints, including low capacity utilisation, under-capitalisation, a weak financial base, high production costs, as well as difficulty in meeting WHO prequalification criteria.\r\n\r\nHowever, with some pharmaceutical firms such as Evans, SWIPHA, CHI Pharmaceuticals, May and Baker, and Fidson Healthcare plc in the process of upgrading and/or building new facilities in preparation to meet these prequalification requirements, we believe this development will promote local production, given the increased opportunity to participate in international tenders, such as WHO, United Nations Children Fund (UNICEF), United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), UNITAID and the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, TB and Malaria. No doubt, WHO prequalification will help the nation to become self-sufficient in the manufacture of essential medicines, which will invariably have multiplier effects on the economy with creation of thousands of jobs and more foreign exchange earnings for the country.\r\n\r\nNigeria can learn from the India experience. The emergence of India’s pharmaceutical industry on the global landscape as a strong generics player allowed only process patents in pharmaceutical products. This development kept the cost of medicines at affordable levels by enabling domestic pharmaceutical firms to build technical expertise in reverse engineering of existing medicines by modifying the manufacturing process, thereby becoming efficient producers of generic drugs.', 9, '2013-09-26 09:53:39', 0, NULL, NULL),

While commending the Kano State government for some talks towards that direction, with the pharmacists association in the state, the Acting Registrar of Pharmaceutical Council of Nigeria, Mrs. Gloria O. Amuveri, maintained that if such intervention funds became operational, monitoring and ensuring the quality of drugs would be enhanced.\r\n\r\n  She made the call recently in Kano, in an interview with the newsmen. “It gives effective checks and balances while monitoring the compliance to manufacturing practices,” she added.\r\n\r\n  According to her more people would be gainfully employed and the sources of drugs would also be known without any hitch, she lamented. With such funds, she explained, the Council could institutionalize the drugs distribution channels in the country.\r\n\r\n  “Another advantage we can derive from such funds is, we will now have more indigenous companies manufacturing what we consume. If indigenous companies are the ones manufacturing then we can do what is called marketing surveillance. We can also have what is called ‘Recall Processes and Procedures,’” the registrar emphasized.\r\n\r\n  Amuveri assured that that would also mean very good development to the entire healthcare system in the country.\r\n\r\n  On interns, she highlighted that the council was doing everything possible to encourage the state health facilities to ensure that they employed interns, being a continuous training process by the professionals. “We wrote to all the states in the federation that it was imperative that interns were employed by the state governments.

The aim is to encourage young and not-so-young professionals in the diaspora who are trying to make the decision of whether to move back to Nigeria. In collaboration with the brilliant team at MoveBackToNigeria.com, we hope to bring you a weekly interview with individuals who have successfully made the leap. The idea is to share their successes and their challenges as they made the decision.\r\n\r\nA lot of Nigerians in the diaspora have questions about making a change at home in Nigeria. Many suggest really good ideas on how to make things better; others would like to contribute to making a difference back home but are just not sure where to begin.\r\n\r\nThis week, we excitedly bring you a feature on a young Nigerian pharmacist (he  has chosen to remain anonymous) who is moving back to Nigeria to pursue his dreams in the health sector and beyond. Read on, to hear him talk about his career so far, his hopes and plans for his pharmaceutical practice and his take on the pharmaceutical industry in Nigeria. We hope you enjoy reading his story.\r\n\r\nThanks for agreeing to speak to us. Could you kindly tell us who you are?\r\nI’m a young Nigerian pharmacist, living and working in London, England and looking to move back to Nigeria in the next few months. My interests range from sports to music and everything in between.\r\n\r\nWhen did you leave Nigeria and why?\r\nI left Nigeria for the UK in 2001 for educational reasons.\r\n\r\nCan you shed some light on these educational reasons?\r\nSure. I left Nigeria after secondary school to do my A Levels in the UK and subsequently attend university there as well.  I studied pharmacy at Cardiff University and graduated with a Masters in Pharmacy.\r\n\r\nDid you always know you wanted to be a pharmacist?\r\nNot necessarily. Whilst I was proficient in science subjects, I was not always sure of what science I wanted to practice. My dad then decided on pharmacy and I’m happy to say it’s turned out to be a worthy decision.\r\n\r\nThat’s certainly fortunate. So how did your career in pharmacy begin?\r\nWell, it’s a seemingly convoluted path so do bear with me as I narrate. In the UK, after studying pharmacy, there’s a 1 year mandatory ‘pre-registration’ program (similar to the housemanship in medicine) which involves 1 year of working, shadowing a pharmacist and a very challenging professional exam afterwards. I undertook mine at Tesco Pharmacy, thankfully passed the exams and then registered as a pharmacist in the UK. I then went back to Cardiff University for another Masters degree, this time in Strategic Marketing as I felt that my business skills were lacking and I needed to remedy that. This I did for long term reasons because, I knew I would one day be going back to Nigeria to set up a pharmacy and I wanted to have the entrepreneurial skills necessary to market my drugs. After this degree, I got a job at Superdrug which lasted only briefly as the visa rules got changed and so I had to prematurely leave the UK for Nigeria.\r\n\r\nAlthough I was somewhat disillusioned at the prospect, I decided to use the opportunity to undertake the NYSC program. However, when I got home, I realised that I was misinformed about the NYSC procedure, particularly as it applies to graduates of medicine and pharmacy. You have to register as a pharmacist and then take a 6week course which is rotated nationwide and runs once annually, before being eligible for NYSC. I had unfortunately arrived months before the course and did not relish the prospect of waiting idly which led me to decide to come back to the UK for a third Masters degree, this time in Global Affairs at the University of Buckingham. I did this alongside a part-time pharmacist job in Boots and I stayed with them, even after the completion of my course while planning another move back to Nigeria; this time much more thought out and researched. After Boots, a better opportunity presented itself at Sainsbury’s Pharmacy and I took it and that’s where I currently work as the pharmacy manager.\r\n\r\nYou’ve mentioned a few times, your unwavering intent to return to Nigeria. Why this mindset?\r\nMoving back to Nigeria should be a decision based on personal circumstances. After all is said and done and despite the very well documented infrastructural and societal challenges in Nigeria, there’s still nowhere like home. I have a very good job in the UK and live a comfortable life but I feel that going home now is the right thing to do, for me.  I would like to be closer to my family, most of whom reside there and I would also like to set up my pharmacy practice in Nigeria, God willing. It is where I want to be and where I am happiest.\r\n\r\nWhilst I’m there, the intent is to get some hands on work experience, register my company and prepare for NYSC. Another reason is that there is a huge influx of pharmacists into the UK and so the money is not even what it used to be. The sector here is also getting very saturated for instance, because of EU laws, pharmacists from eastern Europe can come to the UK, shadow a pharmacist for a month and then get their license irrespective of whatever sort of training (or not) they may received in their home countries.\r\n\r\nThat’s understandable. You have discussed setting up your Pharmacy in Nigeria, can you go into some detail and tell us what this would entail?\r\nMy background in pharmacy and business has prepared me for this and it is something I want to do for a myriad of reasons. Operating a small, retail pharmacy is a profitable venture, it is also one that by its very nature will meet a very basic human need as I plan to site it close to schools, hospitals and potentially also specialise in certain medication(s), be a distributor, supplying private and public establishments and much more. I’m very optimistic about moving back and while I am very aware that things don’t always turn out as planned, particularly in the uncertain Nigerian terrain, I’m just hoping for the best.\r\n\r\nThis naturally leads us to the pharmaceutical industry in Nigeria and bodies like PCN & NAFDAC. What are your thoughts regarding these regulatory bodies?\r\nThe pharmaceutical industry in Nigeria is definitely progressing.  However, I feel we need to start manufacturing more medicines in Nigeria. The obvious infrastructural challenges certainly pose obstacles to this but it’s an area that should be better explored. We need more companies like Emzor, Orange Drugs and so on as a lot of medicines are currently imported from India and China which is not the route I would personally take if given the opportunity. There is more that can be done to increase our production especially considering we have the raw materials in abundance and a good example of this is maize starch which is a major component of most medicines.\r\n\r\nThe regulatory agencies like NAFDAC (National Agency for Food & Drug Administration and Control) and PCN (Pharmacists Council of Nigeria) need to be empowered and constitutionalized so as to be more effective and also to eliminate the crippling bureaucracy.  There are existing policies which go a long way towards curbing illegal practices. Many people are not aware of the existing industry rules and this is due to the fact that they are hardly enforced. One such rule is one in which if a businessman wants to set up a pharmacy, there must an in-house pharmacist who must own at least 40% of the business so as to ensure best practice. The PCN also needs to organise more public enlightenment campaigns for citizens to be aware of the laws and policies. For instance medication like Valium and Lexotan by law are prescription only in Nigeria but a lot of people flout these stipulations.\r\n\r\nWhat unique opportunities exist in the industry for people who may also be considering a move back?\r\nThere are many opportunities that abound, just take the size of Nigeria into consideration. There are 36 states in Nigeria with each one presenting a unique opportunity to whoever is interested and with the wherewithal to power the interest. For instance, I know someone who lives in Delta State but chooses to travel to the neighbouring Edo State to purchase medication for her kids when the need arises. There might be pharmacies close to her but she chooses to go all the way and it may be a function of the origin of the drugs sold by the pharmacies. She may just prefer European brands such as GSK or Roche to the Asian brands which are what abound in Nigeria and so here exists an opportunity for a business venture. Also, the WHO states that the fake drugs market In Africa is worth millions of dollars and we have a lot of people coming in from neighbouring countries like Ghana and Cameroon to buy medicines in Nigeria and so this is another opportunity to come in and present an ethical and alternative change.\r\n\r\nThis is all very enlightening and you’re clearly very passionate about this cause. Where then, do you see yourself and potentially, your pharmacy in 3 to 5 years?\r\nHopefully in a stable and successful position.  I intend to eventually expand and open more branches of my pharmacy as well as be a key player in the sector. I have already started the legwork and so with hard work and God’s blessings, the sky is just the foundation.\r\n\r\nThat’s certainly positive. On a final note and as you’re somewhat in the transition process, what would you say to people considering a similar move?\r\nYou need to know before you go. Do not just make hasty decisions. I see a lot of people you’ve interviewed on the MoveBackToNigeria.com website who’ve successfully made the move back home are either in the finance sector or the engineering sector and that’s understandable as those sectors are currently enjoying a boom. It is not the same for the health sector and anyone who does not do sufficient research will most likely encounter problems. Doctors are not doing so well back home except those who run their own clinics.\r\n\r\nAnother point to remember is that you need to be open-minded and not compare Nigerian systems to those in the west. It’s also important to be patient and hardworking and eventually, things should pay off.\r\n\r\n Thank you very much for your time and best wishes moving forward.', 4, '2013-09-26 09:53:39', 0, NULL, NULL),
(57, '\r\nCan Nigeria’s manufacturing, pharmaceutical industry compete? (2) – Prof.Soludo', 'The former Central Bank governor, Prof. Charles Soludo in a recent forum organised by Nigeria Association of Industrial Pharmacists (NAIP) in Lagos, has questioned the ability of Nigeria’s manufacturing and pharmaceutical industry to compete in the global market with certain indices pointing to that direction.\r\n\r\nAs I review the global industry, the structural shifts and market trends, I do not have good news for the audience here. I refer specifically to the pharmaceutical manufacturers among your membership. As of today, Nigeria has neither a comparative nor a competitive advantage in pharmaceuticals.\r\n\r\n(To deliberately create a competitive advantage will require serious strategizing and effort). On cost considerations, Nigerian firms cannot compete: the risk-adjusted rate of return on investment in the industry is comparatively very low. It is not surprising that the global majors in the industry are not pouring in capital. Estimated at about US$l,billion (less than 0.5% of Nigeria’s GDP and basically the size of a medium-sized pharmaceutical company abroad) the share of Nigeria’s, pharmaceutical industry in the global industry is basically zero.\r\n\r\nLocal manufacfure has been consistently losing market shares in the local market let alone being competitive in the international market. I understand that todate, none of the pharmaceutical companies in Nigeria is WHO- certified. If you adjust for the outsourced production to foreign firms, the 100 or so largely small and fragmented companies in the industry account for about 20% of domestic drug consumption.\r\n\r\nIt is a struggling industry. Some of the existing firms have resorted to a number of ‘survivalist strategies’ by joining the ‘trading train – as marketers for foreign firms or have outsourced their production to Indian and Chinese manufacturers while, they are more amply rewarded as happy importers. I will not be surprised if out of your 300 corporate members, more than 60% are in the marketing/distribution segment.\r\n\r\nI will not waste your time with a rehearsal of why and how the industry is not competitive. You probably have a better list of the reasons. The bottomline is that it is subject to the same competitive disadvantages as the productive sector especially manufacturing.\r\n\r\nThe industry cannot withstand the drug armada from China and India in particular – which have by far better cost advantages – and you cannot stop them from coming given our obligations under the General Agreement on Trade and Tariffs (GATT) and the World Trade Organization (WTO). Some of you complain that the industry is a victim of unfair trade (characterized by inflow of fake, illegal, substandard drugs or even ‘dumping’) while the government does little to ‘protect’ or patronize the industry.\r\n\r\nSome demand for special, cheaper funds for pharmaceuticals production. The list is long. I will argue that some of the proposals, if implemented, will merely act as short to medium term palliatives. In your language, administering only pain killers to a patient with malaria will not make him well.\r\n\r\nWhere do we go from here?\r\n\r\nSome analysts believe that the national development discourse is saddled with creeping analysis paralysis.\r\n\r\nPhilosophers, it is said, have interpreted the world: the problem is to change it! As I review the National Economic Empowerment and Development Strategy – NEEDS – or its revised version in the name of Vision 2020 document, the various ‘conclusions’ of the annual Nigerian Economic Summit, and the sundry ‘blueprints’ f1ying around you almost come to the conclusion that the missing link is a focused execution capacity.\r\n', 15, '2013-09-26 09:53:39', 0, NULL, NULL),

But the contrary reality by these research findings may hold critical lessons for Nigeria and other countries with strong dependence and increased public confidence in foreign medical supplies for the day to day management of domestic healthcare problems.\r\n\r\nFor instance, when a call was made in April 2012 by NAFDAC that a 200 billion naira Pharmaceutical Intervention Fund be established in Nigeria, the idea was viewed by many people as financially expensive. According to official statements, the proposed Fund would be used in\r\nfinancing loans to local pharmaceutical firms in order to enhance their capacity for more production or possible expansion. Yet, the idea received some resentment from a section of the Nigerian masses.\r\n\r\nBut this critical report by American researchers may become a strong reason for most of them to now reconsider their respective positions on the matter, particularly as the nations on which Nigeria depends for health safety are being linked with consumer risks and other regulatory challenges.\r\n\r\nOn July 26, 2000, the Journal of the American Medical Association (Vol. 284, No. 4) reported that, every day, 290 people are killed by prescription drugs approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration, FDA. The report was authored by Dr. Barbara Starfield (MD, MPH) of the Johns Hopkins School of Hygiene and Public Health, who also placed the annual figure for deaths from the adverse effects of FDA-approved prescription medications at 106, 000 people.\r\n\r\nWith this manner of scary statistics from reputable medical sources, the regulation of consumer imports in Nigeria deserves to be treated as an urgent matter of national security. In order to achieve this, there must be a clearly laid_out plan to increase local production of pharmaceutical goods and enhance proportional reduction in the amount of imported medical supplies.\r\n\r\nAlready, there are favourable conditions for achieving this, but the Nigerian government seems to be going slow in this direction. Recently, the World Health Organization, WHO, certified Pan African Foundation, PAF, as a potential beneficiary of the NAFDAC-proposed Fund.  PAF is a Nigerian disposable syringe manufacturing company based in Port Harcourt, and was one among 11 other companies selected by NAFDAC for the WHO prequalification exercise. The company won a place alongside more others in South Africa, Uganda and Morocco, thus completing a list of seven companies endorsed by experts from US and the European Union.\r\n\r\nIn technical terms, a pre_qualification by WHO gives pharmaceutical companies the franchise of marketing their products worldwide. If PAF succeeds to function this way, it will not only strengthen the nation’s arm of consumer safety but also boost its revenue base.\r\n\r\nHowever, without a swift reaction to the NAFDAC-proposed Fund, Nigeria may only be sitting on her prospects in the sustainable management of its healthcare sector.\r\n\r\n*Mr.  Ikyaa, a commentator on national issues, wrote from Abuja.', 15, '2013-09-26 09:53:39', 0, NULL, NULL),
(59, '\r\nAppraising Nigeria’s need for a pharmaceutical intervention fund', 'Mr. Lolu Ojo, Chief Executive Officer of Merit HealthCare Limited and Chairman of the Nigerian Association of Industrial Pharmacists (NAIP) in this interview with BEN NDUBUWA spoke on the need for government to help the pharmaceutical industry grow through  patronage as well as putting in place policies to check the incidence of fake drugs.\r\n\r\nWhat are the challenges facing the pharmaceutical industry?\r\n\r\nThe challenges of the pharmaceutical industry in Nigeria are myriad just like every other sector of the economy. First we do not have a conducive environment to operate in. The truth is that the environment is hostile to business growth and development. However, we are determined and we have charged our people to rise above the harsh economic environment.  We believe that as the day goes by, we will survive and give thanks to God.\r\n\r\nWhat more can you say in an environment where you generate your own electricity, build your borehole for water, pay for security, build your roads and drainage, among others. For instance, in the past one month or so, we had no light because some vandals stole the cable from the transformer. So, everyday, we run the generator to keep the business going. For me this is one of the greatest challenges.\r\n\r\nAgain, as you are probably aware, 70 per cent of all the pharmaceutical products consumed in this country are actually imported. Therefore, any swing in the foreign exchange rate directly impact on our businesses. If, for instance, you had made an order for some products and there is a change in the exchange rate that is not favourable you will be in trouble. This is an economy where you cannot increase price arbitrarily because the customer is already complaining of the old price not being affordable.\r\n\r\n The upward swing in exchange rate, which had been our lot in the past few years, erodes our margin and limit our ability to expand, upgrade facilities, employ more people, take risks/higher challenges, etc. More so, banks’ interest rate is not better. It is the most unfriendly compared to what happens in other climes. We pay as much as 25 per cent or more.  The high cost of production is quite challenging.\r\n\r\nSome of our colleagues, including myself, are into importation not necessarily because we want to but more because it offers a more convenient platform to start business. I would have preferred to be in manufacturing and we have decided that, no matter what it is going to cost, we will start our own production soon. The fear all over the place is that of inadequate power supply. For instance, if your production line is busy producing and all of a sudden the power goes off and assuming my generator is faulty, the worst that will happen to me as an importer is the inconveniences of not being able to use the computer systems or the office, but, it is not the same for a manufacturer. The loss would be enormous.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nAs chairman of NAIP, what do you intend to achieve?\r\n\r\nNAIP is a technical arm of the Pharmaceutical Society of Nigeria (PSN). The members of NAIP are those pharmacists who are not in the hospitals, community pharmacy practice, or in the academia. We have a lot of pharmacists in the banks, in telecommunications, in the oil industry and other areas.  \r\n\r\n As a group, we are stronger and able to speak with bigger and louder voice and we can mobilise our members and engage in those things that will favour them. As a body, whether you are manufacturing, marketing or other forms of industrial pharmacy, the important thing is that we come together instead of having a cacophony of voices. That way, we have resemblance of orderliness and one voice.\r\n\r\nJust recently, we had a stakeholders’ meeting to streamline the process of handling product complaints. Not only that, just like any other association, we can call ourselves to order and we can call companies to order as well. If pharmacists that are working with companies and are not doing well, we call them to order. We have handled so many cases like that. We also work on development, For instance, we have set up a business academy called ‘NAIP Business Academy’.\r\n\r\nIt is a training institution and the objective is to fill the skill and knowledge gaps that we have observed in the industry. When we started as sales representative, we were trained for up to three to four months. This is hardly the case now. So, it has become imperative that the Association should set up such an institution for our members.\r\n\r\nIt is unfortunate the some multinationals that we take pleasure in condemning are the ones that took extra time to train us before allowing us to go to the field. This institution is to take care of this gap created by the exit of some of these companies.  Unfortunately, the multinationals left because of the difficult operating environment. The Pfizer, Bayer, Roche, etc, they all left Nigeria then, though they are coming back but not as big as they were before their exit. Most of them now have a simple marketing office in the country.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nWhat Is attracting the multinationals back?\r\n\r\nYou cannot ignore Nigeria. The whole world is looking towards Nigeria as the next place for investment. Do you know what is happening in America and Europe now? Africa and Nigeria is surely the next destination for investment. You cannot ignore 160 million people. I learnt about the assertion of the CEO of Shoprite if as it is being widely circulated that 60 percent of Nigerians are living below poverty level, the remaining 40 percent that are probably above the poverty line is more than the population of South Africa.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nHow is your relationship with NAFDAC?         \r\n\r\nOur relationship with NAFDAC is normal but not optimal. I sincerely hope that before the end of my tenure as the national chairman of NAIP, the relationship will get better. I had actually led a delegation of NAIP members to the DG of NAFDAC’s office to declare our support and readiness to work with the agency. As a gentle man, he is good; his intentions are genuine and altruistic. There is need for more contact.\r\n\r\n A delegation of PSN recently met the DG and it was agreed that we need to interact more irrespective our differences for the good of the nation. Unfortunately, I could not attend that meeting because of other pressing and earlier scheduled NAIP assignment. We need to discuss and agree on issues and interventions in a free atmosphere before execution. Some issues or interventions like anti-faking devices, etc need the support of everybody for success.\r\n\r\nNAFDAC is a regulating institution and not a ‘strangulator’. The pharmaceutical industry form more than 80 per cent of NAFDAC’s clientele base. Therefore, we need each other for the sector to be vibrant. It is to our interest for a regulatory body like NAFDAC to be vibrant and alive to her responsibilities.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nHow do you feel about fake drugs coming from Asian countries?    \r\n\r\nUntil we change our attitude it will continue. The people bringing in fake drugs are Nigerians. Whether it is Musa, Okechukwu, Laolu or Ekaitte the thing is that they are Nigerians. There is nothing wrong with India or China. All the products you see on the shelves in Europe and America are from China and India; these drugs are made there because the cost of production is low. It is our people that go to tell these people don’t worry instead of 250 mg make it 50mg and label it 250mg and ship it to me I will sell them. What we tell our people is that they should buy from the right source.', 5, '2013-09-26 09:53:39', 0, NULL, NULL),

According to Mr Nnamdi Okafor, the CEO, May & Baker Plc, the problems, which range from intense competition, low capacity utilization, serious faking and adulteration of original brands and even low buying power of customers, have been giving the industry a reputation of low profitability and return on investment.\r\n\r\nBut how does he intend to go through with these problems as the new helmsman of a 67-year-old healthcare institution?\r\n\r\n''I have my ideas on where I want to take the company which is also in tandem with the corporate vision.

Okafor said at an interactive session with media men, his first ever since assuming office, where he bared it all on his roadmap to take the company to its promised land. To him, the strength of any company is a reflection of the strength of its brands. ''So we intend to increase our support for our brands. We recognize that May & Baker is a strong brand and we shall continue to build on that strength'', he added.\r\n\r\nOkafor, a fellow of the Pharmaceutical Society of Nigeria(PSN) and the Nigerian Institute of Management (NIM) and an alumnus of the Lagos Business School, has been with May & Baker since 1985. He became the managing director of May & Baker Nigeria Plc on February 1, 2011 following the appointment of his predecessor, Dr Joseph Odumodu, as the Director-General of the Standards Organisation of Nigeria (SON).\r\n\r\nHe holds a Bachelor of Pharmacy degree from the then University of Ife, Ile-Ife (now Obafemi Awolowo University, Ife) as well as Master of Business Administration (MBA) in Marketing from ESUT Business School, Lagos.

So we are standing on a solid ground and are very proud of what he accomplished.''\r\n\r\nThis solid ground he promised to build on to make it a greater height by turning May & Baker to one of the fastest growing and profitable businesses in its category. ''This we intend to accomplish by developing a strategic mindset, putting our business on a rapid, stable and sustainable growth path, building systems and processes that function seamlessly and developing appetite for stretch financial goals. We are already working on a new strategic plan which will form the new road map for our journey towards our vision.''\r\n\r\nIn this piece, he shed more light on how he intends to achieve this lofty ideals.\r\n\r\nExcerpts:\r\nBackground\r\nI became the managing director of May & Baker Nigeria Plc on February 1, 2011. As you are aware, the transition became necessary when our immediate past managing director, Dr Joseph Odumodu, was appointed the Director-General of the Standards Organisation of Nigeria (SON) by the President. I am not new to the May & Baker family, having spent the 25 years of my working life in the company. If anything, I can say with every sense of modesty that I am indeed on a familiar terrain having also been on the board of this company as executive director for the past eight years.\r\n\r\nMy participation in the management of this company over these years has given me good knowledge of the business and will help me avoid past mistakes in trying to chart a new course for the company. However, it has its potential pitfall which is a tendency to perpetrate status quo. I can however assure you that the latter will not be the case here.\r\n\r\nThis is because the first thing I did on assumption of this new role is to reset my clock to my first day at work in May & Baker. This is to enable me see opportunities for change. It is clear to me that the only way to move this business to a new level is by implementing change through injection of new ideas and ways of doing things. So we will implement change. But we shall not implement change for the sake of change, we will only implement changes that will enhance our processes, business results and ultimately shareholder value.\r\n\r\nVision\r\nI want to put it on record the fact that I inherited a good company. Our former managing director did a fantastic job in his 22 years of service to this company, 13 of which were spent at the helm of affairs. He navigated this company through its most turbulent years and put it on a sound pedestal with impressive revenue and profit growth, robust asset base and strong corporate reputation. So we are standing on a solid ground and are very proud of what he accomplished.\r\n\r\nOn this note, permit me to give you an outline of my vision for the company and the strategic direction of the new management. May and Baker has a corporate vision which is ''To Be Among the Top 10 Conglomerates in Nigeria by 2020''. That vision remains unchanged because we believe it is the best we can have at this time. It was the collective decision of the management team taken at a strategic retreat three years ago and we shall vigorously pursue this dream.\r\n\r\nHowever, I have my ideas on where I want to take the company which is also in tandem with the corporate vision. We want to take this good company that has been handed over to us and turn it into a great company. A truly strong and stable world-class company powered by strong global brands, aggressive business diversification, optimum business process efficiency and good corporate governance principles.\r\n\r\nTo me the strength of a company is a reflection of the strength of its brands. So we intend to increase our support for our brands.\r\n\r\nWe recognize that May & Baker is a strong brand and we shall continue to build on that strength. However we also recognize that this equity is only strong with the older generation. Therefore we will deliberately target the younger generation with products and corporate social responsibility initiatives that will appeal to their lifestyle. Our strategic intent is to make May & Baker one of the fastest growing and profitable businesses in it''s category.\r\n\r\nThis we intend to accomplish by; developing a strategic mindset, putting our business on a rapid, stable and sustainable growth path, building systems and processes that function seamlessly and developing appetite for stretch financial goals. We are already working on a new strategic plan which will form the new road map for our journey towards our vision. This plan will be unveiled in the next three months and guide all our subsequent investments and resource deployment.\r\n\r\nCSR\r\nIn May & Baker we have supported the society through various sponsorships and donations to individuals, professional groups, governmental and non-governmental bodies. We intend to move a step further by being a credible source of information on public health and safety education, awareness and disease prevention. To achieve these objectives we are interested in partnering with societies and groups that invest in social wellbeing\r\n\r\nNew plant\r\nAs some of you are aware, May & Baker started a new pharmaceutical plant in Ota in 2008. It is a world class plant designed to blaze the trail in Nigeria as the country''s first WHO pre-Qualified pharmaceutical facility. This feat is meant to be not only a corporate accomplishment but also a national achievement. With it, Nigeria will be recording another first in West and Central Africa because the plant would be the first of its kind in these sub-regions. When fully certified by the WHO, the pharma plant in Ota will open a gateway to international business as well as help conserve the country''s foreign exchange in the area of drugs. This facility will be open to both local and international drug procuring entities who currently buy from Western and Asian manufacturers.\r\n\r\nThe facility, which has taken investment in excess of N3 billion, is now near completion and will have a capacity of about 30 billion tablets and 25 million bottles per annum working only two eight-hour shifts per day. This, in addition to our current capacities at the Ikeja factory, will represent a significant percentage of Nigeria''s drug requirement. The successful take-off of this plant in a short time is a major objective of the new management. In the years ahead we shall remain focused while playing on high stakes. We have plans to take full advantage of new openings in the economy and shall vigorously pursue opportunities in the export business especially within the West African sub region under the common external tariff programme of ECOWAS.\r\n\r\nWHO certification\r\nWe are not the only company in Nigeria that is going for the World Health Organization (WHO) certification . But I believe that we have the best chance of getting it because we have the best chance of getting it because we have the best facility. The process of getting WHO certification is a long process. It takes up to 18 months. It is a long process of documentation and it is also a political process. We are working very hard to get it in record time and I want to also say that NAFDAC is doing a very good job in this area by trying to assist companies which are ready to collaborate with WHO. We are going to Geneva next month(April) for a workshop meant to open up an avenue where drug manufacturers would interact with WHO officials who are in charge of this process.\r\n\r\nThat will facilitate the time frame for achieving it.\r\n\r\nChallenges\r\nYou know, the new plant is a very massive project. And I would say that we underestimated what would be involved. And as the project gets towards completion stage, we have challenges. So we have challenges with some of our contractors who started appealing for reviews and reviews. And at some point, we could not continue to grant such requests. So we have to change the main contractor who was working on the project. And in doing so, we lost some months-about two or three months. But I want to reassure you that that factory will start test running by the end of this month (March). We should be ready to start running on some products by the end of this month. And before the end of half year, we should officially commission that facility.\r\n\r\nThe year 2011 promises to be a very uncertain year for business generally. The reasons among others include the April general elections, adverse weather conditions in Asia and impact on food prices, revolution in the Middle East and impact on crude oil supply and prices and the overall impact of all these on inflation and purchasing power of an average Nigerian. As you are all aware, the pharmaceutical industry has been challenged over the years by various issues ranging from intense competition, low capacity utilization, serious faking and adulteration of original brands and even low buying power of customers.\r\n\r\nThis has given the industry a reputation of low profitability and return on investment. However at May and Baker Nigeria PLC, rather than being deterred by these negative signals, we have decided to drive our business and have performed above industry average. Our key strategies for higher performance in 2011 include stronger support for our brands especially our foods brand Mimee Noodles, broadening of our products offering and expected increase in output following commissioning of our Ota plant.\r\n\r\nWe are embarking on various expansion projects to deliver an enviable company for all. What we promise the shareholders is that we shall continue to make their investments in our company worthwhile by ensuring that they enjoy the benefits accruable from a strong entity in terms of returns on investment, capital appreciation and security of investment. We intend to excite our shareholders with more robust dividends.\r\n\r\nProducts\r\nCrunch Mee is still in the market but I must say it is not doing as much as we have wanted. The reason is that consumers seem not to like the way it is presented. People want it to be in form that would be easier for them to manage. At some point, we had to change its flavour and in that way improve its acceptability. We are in the process of reformulating it. But for it to get to the level that we want , the form will have to change and that will also involve some capital expenses. And because we are struggling to finish the one that we are doing, we are not in a hurry to put in money in buying machines for now. Mimee too is not out of the market.\r\n\r\nWe are very much in the market. Mimee is also not operating at 100 per cent capacity. We still have some spare capacity. What is happening is that that industry has full capacity. Some people came in, Dangote came in, Flourmills came in, Honeywell has been there. So we have a lot of capacity. In fact, Dangote built three factories and as I talk to you now, only one is functioning. The other two are down because the operators in the industry, unfortunately, are not expanding demand at the pace in which capacity was going up. There is some tough competition going on. That is why we have decided to, on our own, do something about demand. Very soon, we are going to be breaking our new campaign. And that campaign, I believe, is meant to sensitise the consumers and to get more people to try Mimee.\r\n\r\nAdulteration\r\nI am aware that some 10 years ago, this was a very bad situation because it was being done on two fronts: One, people were doing their own here and some were going outside Nigeria to also adulterate or fake these products. NAFDAC has done a lot to stem the tide. I would say that the incidence of adulteration has significantly come down. However, we still have issues of products being faked from time to time. I know we have encountered some of our products that were faked outside the country and brought in. And what we did was to quickly get in touch with NAFDAC.\r\n\r\nAnd working with NAFDAC, we were able to round up some of the parties that were involved in it because it was a very big cartel. What we have to do was trying to apply the break to whatever they had done and possibly confiscate the items. But beyond that, the legal system is a bit difficult to go through and we were not being prepared to go the whole hog of trying to imprison the people behind these things. But we just want to keep them uncomfortable and ensure that we dissuade them from continuing.\r\n\r\nOn the issue of faking, if you have followed the trend of the fakers, you will find out that they are evolving. One of the initiatives that we have also subscribed to is the use of identification code for the products. A lot of the products that can easily be faked would have some codes that people can pick up, and send SMS to a particular number and then get confirmation whether such product is genuine or not. As I said, the fakers are evolving, this is technology. For now, I am not sure they have been able to beat that particular system. So we are adopting it. And we keep looking at better ways to handle such situation.\r\n\r\nLiabilities\r\nIt is true that when you inherit assets, you also inherit liabilities. We know the environment that we are operating in and we know that everything is not rosy. And as business, we have liabilities. Of course, the first one is the fact that we need to build stronger brand as a company because that would help us to weather the storm, I mean when there is shock and withstand that shock in the system. If you have very strong brand, you will be able to withstand it.\r\n\r\nOf course, the fact that we are building a factory and we are borrowing money, we will also be paying interest on these funds. And what that means is that it would put some pressure on cash to run the business. That is one area that I am looking at with the Finance Director. That is what I can say for now. We will continue to improve on the good job that the past MD did. And there is always room for improvement.\r\n\r\nFuture plan\r\nWe are set to intensify our drive for rapid business expansion and diversification. We have already concluded plans to deepen our activities in current markets and enter new markets with new exciting products through parent and subsidiary companies. We are also at the verge of expanding our activities into new geographic markets including aggressive Inroads into export markets. We have in place established processes, procedures, policies and control systems that have guided our operations. Notwithstanding that these systems are working satisfactorily, we intend to look at some of them again with a view to making them more efficient. So we intend to continually fine tune our systems, processes and procedures for higher efficiency and better results.\r\n\r\nOur work force remains our most valuable assets. We are proud to have a rare assemblage of highly qualified and dedicated staff. This is made possible because May & Baker has a highly transparent recruitment process that ensures that only people who demonstrate the right competencies, mental and psychological disposition are employed. We shall provide the right environment and training for these talents to blossom into world class work force. We intend to adopt best practices in corporate governance. We shall run the business with the highest level of integrity and compliance with all relevant laws and regulations.\r\n\r\nAdvice\r\nOne thing that I want to say is that we are lucky as a country that we are exporting crude oil. So when the price of this crude oil goes up in the international market, and now that the Niger Delta situation is a bit under control, what this means is that we are going to export more crude; we are going to earn more revenue. The only thing that I would like to request is that the way this money is utilized will make a whole lot of difference.\r\n\r\nAs against what happens now, I mean the sharing of the money among the states and nobody can really accounts for what comes out of the extra windfall, the Federal Government should try to use this money to improve on infrastructure. Because a lot of people in the country are doing nothing because there is no power. For instance , imagine that we have 24 hours power supply, a lot of people will be working and also generate income for themselves. And that would reduce the difficulties that people are facing. It is important that government applies whatever resources(at its disposal) well.\r\n\r\nAnd like what is happening in some countries, food is very critical. The Federal Government should continue with what they are doing, which is subsidizing inputs of agriculture, which is important. And if it is possible, like it is being done in other parts of the world, subsidise some critical commodities like flour. The cost of flour has gone up and Nigerians like bread a lot. This means that they have to pay more for it. I think that the government should step in for such important items to see how the cost can be put under control.

(63, 'Prospect for Nigeria’s pharmaceutical industry ', 'The health needs of a nation reflect on certain essential medicines consumed by the populace. With the determining factor in the pharmaceutical business dependent on increasing disease pattern, over-the-counter (OTC) medicines such as analgesics, antimalarials and multivitamins make up a large share of the Nigerian market. Painkillers, also known as analgesics or antipyretics, have the largest market share of therapeutic classes of medicines locally produced due to their affordability, availability and widespread use for a wide range of symptoms.\r\n\r\nThis revelation, contained in a recent document review of the nation’s pharmaceutical sector tagged “Global United Nations Industrial Development Organisation (UNIDO) Project”, shows that analgesics constitute 25 percent of drugs produced in the country. Others include antibiotics (15 percent), multivitamins + haematinics (15 percent), antimalarial medicines (14 percent), antihypertensives (8 percent), cough and cold preparations (5 percent), antiretroviral medicines (6 percent), external/topical preparations (5 percent), antiTB medicines (4 percent), and others (3 percent).\r\n\r\nThe report shows that the existing large market size, strong demand and the need for management of infectious diseases, especially HIV/AIDS, malaria, TB, and neglected childhood diseases constitute enormous opportunity for pharmaceutical firms to produce therapeutic drugs to meet the health needs of Nigerians.\r\n\r\nCurrently, Nigeria is responsible for about 60 percent of medicines consumed in the ECOWAS by volume, underlining the huge sub-regional market of an estimated 600 million people, according to Pharmaceutical Manufacturing Group, Manufacturers’ Association of Nigeria (PMG-MAN). Trade incentives introduced by ECOWAS for pharmaceuticals within West Africa are helping to promote movement of pharmaceuticals within the sub-region, experts believe. Furthermore, the West African Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association (WAPMA) is working to enhance confidence in the quality of medicines produced locally and promote business in the sub-region.\r\n\r\nEstimates of the size of the nation’s pharmaceutical market vary. Business Monitor International (BMI) in 2009 estimated Nigeria’s pharmaceutical market at $600 million. Out of this figure, BMI attributes the largest share of $418 million to generic medicines, $121 million to OTC products, and $61 million to patented products.\r\n\r\nEqually, Frost & Sullivan, a growing partnership company, estimated a pharmaceutical market value of $740 million in 2009. Out of this figure, $266.4 million was attributed to generic medicines, $177.6 million to branded products, and $296 million to OTC products.\r\n\r\nDrug manufacturers in the country are faced with several constraints, including low capacity utilisation, under-capitalisation, a weak financial base, high production costs, as well as difficulty in meeting WHO prequalification criteria.\r\n\r\nHowever, with some pharmaceutical firms such as Evans, SWIPHA, CHI Pharmaceuticals, May and Baker, and Fidson Healthcare plc in the process of upgrading and/or building new facilities in preparation to meet these prequalification requirements, we believe this development will promote local production, given the increased opportunity to participate in international tenders, such as WHO, United Nations Children Fund (UNICEF), United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), UNITAID and the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, TB and Malaria. No doubt, WHO prequalification will help the nation to become self-sufficient in the manufacture of essential medicines, which will invariably have multiplier effects on the economy with creation of thousands of jobs and more foreign exchange earnings for the country.\r\n\r\nNigeria can learn from the India experience. The emergence of India’s pharmaceutical industry on the global landscape as a strong generics player allowed only process patents in pharmaceutical products. This development kept the cost of medicines at affordable levels by enabling domestic pharmaceutical firms to build technical expertise in reverse engineering of existing medicines by modifying the manufacturing process, thereby becoming efficient producers of generic drugs.', 9, '2013-09-26 09:53:39', 0, NULL, NULL),

If indigenous companies are the ones manufacturing then we can do what is called marketing surveillance.

The aim is to encourage young and not-so-young professionals in the diaspora who are trying to make the decision of whether to move back to Nigeria. In collaboration with the brilliant team at MoveBackToNigeria.com, we hope to bring you a weekly interview with individuals who have successfully made the leap. The idea is to share their successes and their challenges as they made the decision.\r\n\r\nA lot of Nigerians in the diaspora have questions about making a change at home in Nigeria. Many suggest really good ideas on how to make things better; others would like to contribute to making a difference back home but are just not sure where to begin.\r\n\r\nThis week, we excitedly bring you a feature on a young Nigerian pharmacist (he  has chosen to remain anonymous) who is moving back to Nigeria to pursue his dreams in the health sector and beyond. Read on, to hear him talk about his career so far, his hopes and plans for his pharmaceutical practice and his take on the pharmaceutical industry in Nigeria. We hope you enjoy reading his story.\r\n\r\nThanks for agreeing to speak to us. Could you kindly tell us who you are?\r\nI’m a young Nigerian pharmacist, living and working in London, England and looking to move back to Nigeria in the next few months. My interests range from sports to music and everything in between.\r\n\r\nWhen did you leave Nigeria and why?\r\nI left Nigeria for the UK in 2001 for educational reasons.\r\n\r\nCan you shed some light on these educational reasons?\r\nSure. I left Nigeria after secondary school to do my A Levels in the UK and subsequently attend university there as well.  I studied pharmacy at Cardiff University and graduated with a Masters in Pharmacy.\r\n\r\nDid you always know you wanted to be a pharmacist?\r\nNot necessarily. Whilst I was proficient in science subjects, I was not always sure of what science I wanted to practice. My dad then decided on pharmacy and I’m happy to say it’s turned out to be a worthy decision.\r\n\r\nThat’s certainly fortunate. So how did your career in pharmacy begin?\r\nWell, it’s a seemingly convoluted path so do bear with me as I narrate. In the UK, after studying pharmacy, there’s a 1 year mandatory ‘pre-registration’ program (similar to the housemanship in medicine) which involves 1 year of working, shadowing a pharmacist and a very challenging professional exam afterwards. I undertook mine at Tesco Pharmacy, thankfully passed the exams and then registered as a pharmacist in the UK. I then went back to Cardiff University for another Masters degree, this time in Strategic Marketing as I felt that my business skills were lacking and I needed to remedy that. This I did for long term reasons because, I knew I would one day be going back to Nigeria to set up a pharmacy and I wanted to have the entrepreneurial skills necessary to market my drugs. After this degree, I got a job at Superdrug which lasted only briefly as the visa rules got changed and so I had to prematurely leave the UK for Nigeria.\r\n\r\nAlthough I was somewhat disillusioned at the prospect, I decided to use the opportunity to undertake the NYSC program. However, when I got home, I realised that I was misinformed about the NYSC procedure, particularly as it applies to graduates of medicine and pharmacy. You have to register as a pharmacist and then take a 6week course which is rotated nationwide and runs once annually, before being eligible for NYSC. I had unfortunately arrived months before the course and did not relish the prospect of waiting idly which led me to decide to come back to the UK for a third Masters degree, this time in Global Affairs at the University of Buckingham. I did this alongside a part-time pharmacist job in Boots and I stayed with them, even after the completion of my course while planning another move back to Nigeria; this time much more thought out and researched. After Boots, a better opportunity presented itself at Sainsbury’s Pharmacy and I took it and that’s where I currently work as the pharmacy manager.\r\n\r\nYou’ve mentioned a few times, your unwavering intent to return to Nigeria. Why this mindset?\r\nMoving back to Nigeria should be a decision based on personal circumstances. After all is said and done and despite the very well documented infrastructural and societal challenges in Nigeria, there’s still nowhere like home. I have a very good job in the UK and live a comfortable life but I feel that going home now is the right thing to do, for me.  I would like to be closer to my family, most of whom reside there and I would also like to set up my pharmacy practice in Nigeria, God willing. It is where I want to be and where I am happiest.\r\n\r\nWhilst I’m there, the intent is to get some hands on work experience, register my company and prepare for NYSC. Another reason is that there is a huge influx of pharmacists into the UK and so the money is not even what it used to be. The sector here is also getting very saturated for instance, because of EU laws, pharmacists from eastern Europe can come to the UK, shadow a pharmacist for a month and then get their license irrespective of whatever sort of training (or not) they may received in their home countries.\r\n\r\nThat’s understandable. You have discussed setting up your Pharmacy in Nigeria, can you go into some detail and tell us what this would entail?\r\nMy background in pharmacy and business has prepared me for this and it is something I want to do for a myriad of reasons. Operating a small, retail pharmacy is a profitable venture, it is also one that by its very nature will meet a very basic human need as I plan to site it close to schools, hospitals and potentially also specialise in certain medication(s), be a distributor, supplying private and public establishments and much more. I’m very optimistic about moving back and while I am very aware that things don’t always turn out as planned, particularly in the uncertain Nigerian terrain, I’m just hoping for the best.\r\n\r\nThis naturally leads us to the pharmaceutical industry in Nigeria and bodies like PCN & NAFDAC. What are your thoughts regarding these regulatory bodies?\r\nThe pharmaceutical industry in Nigeria is definitely progressing.  However, I feel we need to start manufacturing more medicines in Nigeria. The obvious infrastructural challenges certainly pose obstacles to this but it’s an area that should be better explored. We need more companies like Emzor, Orange Drugs and so on as a lot of medicines are currently imported from India and China which is not the route I would personally take if given the opportunity. There is more that can be done to increase our production especially considering we have the raw materials in abundance and a good example of this is maize starch which is a major component of most medicines.\r\n\r\nThe regulatory agencies like NAFDAC (National Agency for Food & Drug Administration and Control) and PCN (Pharmacists Council of Nigeria) need to be empowered and constitutionalized so as to be more effective and also to eliminate the crippling bureaucracy.  There are existing policies which go a long way towards curbing illegal practices. Many people are not aware of the existing industry rules and this is due to the fact that they are hardly enforced. One such rule is one in which if a businessman wants to set up a pharmacy, there must an in-house pharmacist who must own at least 40% of the business so as to ensure best practice. The PCN also needs to organise more public enlightenment campaigns for citizens to be aware of the laws and policies. For instance medication like Valium and Lexotan by law are prescription only in Nigeria but a lot of people flout these stipulations.\r\n\r\nWhat unique opportunities exist in the industry for people who may also be considering a move back?\r\nThere are many opportunities that abound, just take the size of Nigeria into consideration. There are 36 states in Nigeria with each one presenting a unique opportunity to whoever is interested and with the wherewithal to power the interest. For instance, I know someone who lives in Delta State but chooses to travel to the neighbouring Edo State to purchase medication for her kids when the need arises. There might be pharmacies close to her but she chooses to go all the way and it may be a function of the origin of the drugs sold by the pharmacies. She may just prefer European brands such as GSK or Roche to the Asian brands which are what abound in Nigeria and so here exists an opportunity for a business venture. Also, the WHO states that the fake drugs market In Africa is worth millions of dollars and we have a lot of people coming in from neighbouring countries like Ghana and Cameroon to buy medicines in Nigeria and so this is another opportunity to come in and present an ethical and alternative change.\r\n\r\nThis is all very enlightening and you’re clearly very passionate about this cause. Where then, do you see yourself and potentially, your pharmacy in 3 to 5 years?\r\nHopefully in a stable and successful position.  I intend to eventually expand and open more branches of my pharmacy as well as be a key player in the sector. I have already started the legwork and so with hard work and God’s blessings, the sky is just the foundation.\r\n\r\nThat’s certainly positive. On a final note and as you’re somewhat in the transition process, what would you say to people considering a similar move?\r\nYou need to know before you go. Do not just make hasty decisions. I see a lot of people you’ve interviewed on the MoveBackToNigeria.com website who’ve successfully made the move back home are either in the finance sector or the engineering sector and that’s understandable as those sectors are currently enjoying a boom. It is not the same for the health sector and anyone who does not do sufficient research will most likely encounter problems. Doctors are not doing so well back home except those who run their own clinics.\r\n\r\nAnother point to remember is that you need to be open-minded and not compare Nigerian systems to those in the west. It’s also important to be patient and hardworking and eventually, things should pay off.\r\n\r\n Thank you very much for your time and best wishes moving forward.', 4, '2013-09-26 09:53:39', 0, NULL, NULL),
(73, '\r\nCan Nigeria’s manufacturing, pharmaceutical industry compete? (2) – Prof.Soludo', 'The former Central Bank governor, Prof. Charles Soludo in a recent forum organised by Nigeria Association of Industrial Pharmacists (NAIP) in Lagos, has questioned the ability of Nigeria’s manufacturing and pharmaceutical industry to compete in the global market with certain indices pointing to that direction.\r\n\r\nAs I review the global industry, the structural shifts and market trends, I do not have good news for the audience here. I refer specifically to the pharmaceutical manufacturers among your membership. As of today, Nigeria has neither a comparative nor a competitive advantage in pharmaceuticals.\r\n\r\n(To deliberately create a competitive advantage will require serious strategizing and effort). On cost considerations, Nigerian firms cannot compete: the risk-adjusted rate of return on investment in the industry is comparatively very low. It is not surprising that the global majors in the industry are not pouring in capital. Estimated at about US$l,billion (less than 0.5% of Nigeria’s GDP and basically the size of a medium-sized pharmaceutical company abroad) the share of Nigeria’s, pharmaceutical industry in the global industry is basically zero.\r\n\r\nLocal manufacfure has been consistently losing market shares in the local market let alone being competitive in the international market. I understand that todate, none of the pharmaceutical companies in Nigeria is WHO- certified. If you adjust for the outsourced production to foreign firms, the 100 or so largely small and fragmented companies in the industry account for about 20% of domestic drug consumption.\r\n\r\nIt is a struggling industry. Some of the existing firms have resorted to a number of ‘survivalist strategies’ by joining the ‘trading train – as marketers for foreign firms or have outsourced their production to Indian and Chinese manufacturers while, they are more amply rewarded as happy importers. I will not be surprised if out of your 300 corporate members, more than 60% are in the marketing/distribution segment.\r\n\r\nI will not waste your time with a rehearsal of why and how the industry is not competitive. You probably have a better list of the reasons. The bottomline is that it is subject to the same competitive disadvantages as the productive sector especially manufacturing.\r\n\r\nThe industry cannot withstand the drug armada from China and India in particular – which have by far better cost advantages – and you cannot stop them from coming given our obligations under the General Agreement on Trade and Tariffs (GATT) and the World Trade Organization (WTO). Some of you complain that the industry is a victim of unfair trade (characterized by inflow of fake, illegal, substandard drugs or even ‘dumping’) while the government does little to ‘protect’ or patronize the industry.\r\n\r\nSome demand for special, cheaper funds for pharmaceuticals production. The list is long. I will argue that some of the proposals, if implemented, will merely act as short to medium term palliatives. In your language, administering only pain killers to a patient with malaria will not make him well.\r\n\r\nWhere do we go from here?\r\n\r\nSome analysts believe that the national development discourse is saddled with creeping analysis paralysis.\r\n\r\nPhilosophers, it is said, have interpreted the world: the problem is to change it! As I review the National Economic Empowerment and Development Strategy – NEEDS – or its revised version in the name of Vision 2020 document, the various ‘conclusions’ of the annual Nigerian Economic Summit, and the sundry ‘blueprints’ f1ying around you almost come to the conclusion that the missing link is a focused execution capacity.\r\n', 15, '2013-09-26 09:53:39', 0, NULL, NULL),

But the contrary reality by these research findings may hold critical lessons for Nigeria and other countries with strong dependence and increased public confidence in foreign medical supplies for the day to day management of domestic healthcare problems.\r\n\r\nFor instance, when a call was made in April 2012 by NAFDAC that a 200 billion naira Pharmaceutical Intervention Fund be established in Nigeria, the idea was viewed by many people as financially expensive. According to official statements, the proposed Fund would be used in\r\nfinancing loans to local pharmaceutical firms in order to enhance their capacity for more production or possible expansion. Yet, the idea received some resentment from a section of the Nigerian masses.\r\n\r\nBut this critical report by American researchers may become a strong reason for most of them to now reconsider their respective positions on the matter, particularly as the nations on which Nigeria depends for health safety are being linked with consumer risks and other regulatory challenges.\r\n\r\nOn July 26, 2000, the Journal of the American Medical Association (Vol. 284, No. 4) reported that, every day, 290 people are killed by prescription drugs approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration, FDA. The report was authored by Dr. Barbara Starfield (MD, MPH) of the Johns Hopkins School of Hygiene and Public Health, who also placed the annual figure for deaths from the adverse effects of FDA-approved prescription medications at 106, 000 people.\r\n\r\nWith this manner of scary statistics from reputable medical sources, the regulation of consumer imports in Nigeria deserves to be treated as an urgent matter of national security. In order to achieve this, there must be a clearly laid_out plan to increase local production of pharmaceutical goods and enhance proportional reduction in the amount of imported medical supplies.\r\n\r\nAlready, there are favourable conditions for achieving this, but the Nigerian government seems to be going slow in this direction. Recently, the World Health Organization, WHO, certified Pan African Foundation, PAF, as a potential beneficiary of the NAFDAC-proposed Fund.  PAF is a Nigerian disposable syringe manufacturing company based in Port Harcourt, and was one among 11 other companies selected by NAFDAC for the WHO prequalification exercise. The company won a place alongside more others in South Africa, Uganda and Morocco, thus completing a list of seven companies endorsed by experts from US and the European Union.\r\n\r\nIn technical terms, a pre_qualification by WHO gives pharmaceutical companies the franchise of marketing their products worldwide. If PAF succeeds to function this way, it will not only strengthen the nation’s arm of consumer safety but also boost its revenue base.\r\n\r\nHowever, without a swift reaction to the NAFDAC-proposed Fund, Nigeria may only be sitting on her prospects in the sustainable management of its healthcare sector.\r\n\r\n*Mr.  Ikyaa, a commentator on national issues, wrote from Abuja.', 15, '2013-09-26 09:53:39', 0, NULL, NULL);

(75, '\r\nAppraising Nigeria’s need for a pharmaceutical intervention fund', 'Mr. Lolu Ojo, Chief Executive Officer of Merit HealthCare Limited and Chairman of the Nigerian Association of Industrial Pharmacists (NAIP) in this interview with BEN NDUBUWA spoke on the need for government to help the pharmaceutical industry grow through  patronage as well as putting in place policies to check the incidence of fake drugs.\r\n\r\nWhat are the challenges facing the pharmaceutical industry?\r\n\r\nThe challenges of the pharmaceutical industry in Nigeria are myriad just like every other sector of the economy. First we do not have a conducive environment to operate in. The truth is that the environment is hostile to business growth and development. However, we are determined and we have charged our people to rise above the harsh economic environment.  We believe that as the day goes by, we will survive and give thanks to God.\r\n\r\nWhat more can you say in an environment where you generate your own electricity, build your borehole for water, pay for security, build your roads and drainage, among others. For instance, in the past one month or so, we had no light because some vandals stole the cable from the transformer. So, everyday, we run the generator to keep the business going. For me this is one of the greatest challenges.\r\n\r\nAgain, as you are probably aware, 70 per cent of all the pharmaceutical products consumed in this country are actually imported. Therefore, any swing in the foreign exchange rate directly impact on our businesses. If, for instance, you had made an order for some products and there is a change in the exchange rate that is not favourable you will be in trouble. This is an economy where you cannot increase price arbitrarily because the customer is already complaining of the old price not being affordable.\r\n\r\n The upward swing in exchange rate, which had been our lot in the past few years, erodes our margin and limit our ability to expand, upgrade facilities, employ more people, take risks/higher challenges, etc. More so, banks’ interest rate is not better. It is the most unfriendly compared to what happens in other climes. We pay as much as 25 per cent or more.  The high cost of production is quite challenging.\r\n\r\nSome of our colleagues, including myself, are into importation not necessarily because we want to but more because it offers a more convenient platform to start business. I would have preferred to be in manufacturing and we have decided that, no matter what it is going to cost, we will start our own production soon. The fear all over the place is that of inadequate power supply. For instance, if your production line is busy producing and all of a sudden the power goes off and assuming my generator is faulty, the worst that will happen to me as an importer is the inconveniences of not being able to use the computer systems or the office, but, it is not the same for a manufacturer. The loss would be enormous.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nAs chairman of NAIP, what do you intend to achieve?\r\n\r\nNAIP is a technical arm of the Pharmaceutical Society of Nigeria (PSN). The members of NAIP are those pharmacists who are not in the hospitals, community pharmacy practice, or in the academia. We have a lot of pharmacists in the banks, in telecommunications, in the oil industry and other areas.  \r\n\r\n As a group, we are stronger and able to speak with bigger and louder voice and we can mobilise our members and engage in those things that will favour them. As a body, whether you are manufacturing, marketing or other forms of industrial pharmacy, the important thing is that we come together instead of having a cacophony of voices. That way, we have resemblance of orderliness and one voice.\r\n\r\nJust recently, we had a stakeholders’ meeting to streamline the process of handling product complaints. Not only that, just like any other association, we can call ourselves to order and we can call companies to order as well. If pharmacists that are working with companies and are not doing well, we call them to order. We have handled so many cases like that. We also work on development, For instance, we have set up a business academy called ‘NAIP Business Academy’.\r\n\r\nIt is a training institution and the objective is to fill the skill and knowledge gaps that we have observed in the industry. When we started as sales representative, we were trained for up to three to four months. This is hardly the case now. So, it has become imperative that the Association should set up such an institution for our members.\r\n\r\nIt is unfortunate the some multinationals that we take pleasure in condemning are the ones that took extra time to train us before allowing us to go to the field. This institution is to take care of this gap created by the exit of some of these companies.  Unfortunately, the multinationals left because of the difficult operating environment. The Pfizer, Bayer, Roche, etc, they all left Nigeria then, though they are coming back but not as big as they were before their exit. Most of them now have a simple marketing office in the country.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nWhat Is attracting the multinationals back?\r\n\r\nYou cannot ignore Nigeria. The whole world is looking towards Nigeria as the next place for investment. Do you know what is happening in America and Europe now? Africa and Nigeria is surely the next destination for investment. You cannot ignore 160 million people. I learnt about the assertion of the CEO of Shoprite if as it is being widely circulated that 60 percent of Nigerians are living below poverty level, the remaining 40 percent that are probably above the poverty line is more than the population of South Africa.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nHow is your relationship with NAFDAC?         \r\n\r\nOur relationship with NAFDAC is normal but not optimal. I sincerely hope that before the end of my tenure as the national chairman of NAIP, the relationship will get better. I had actually led a delegation of NAIP members to the DG of NAFDAC’s office to declare our support and readiness to work with the agency. As a gentle man, he is good; his intentions are genuine and altruistic. There is need for more contact.\r\n\r\n A delegation of PSN recently met the DG and it was agreed that we need to interact more irrespective our differences for the good of the nation. Unfortunately, I could not attend that meeting because of other pressing and earlier scheduled NAIP assignment. We need to discuss and agree on issues and interventions in a free atmosphere before execution. Some issues or interventions like anti-faking devices, etc need the support of everybody for success.\r\n\r\nNAFDAC is a regulating institution and not a ‘strangulator’. The pharmaceutical industry form more than 80 per cent of NAFDAC’s clientele base. Therefore, we need each other for the sector to be vibrant. It is to our interest for a regulatory body like NAFDAC to be vibrant and alive to her responsibilities.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nHow do you feel about fake drugs coming from Asian countries?    \r\n\r\nUntil we change our attitude it will continue. The people bringing in fake drugs are Nigerians. Whether it is Musa, Okechukwu, Laolu or Ekaitte the thing is that they are Nigerians. There is nothing wrong with India or China. All the products you see on the shelves in Europe and America are from China and India; these drugs are made there because the cost of production is low. It is our people that go to tell these people don’t worry instead of 250 mg make it 50mg and label it 250mg and ship it to me I will sell them. What we tell our people is that they should buy from the right source.', 5, '2013-09-26 09:53:39', 0, NULL, NULL),

(77, 'PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY IN NIGERIA IS FACING TOUGH TIME', 'Nnamdi Okafor\r\nThis may not be the best of times for the pharmaceutical industry in the country as the sector is still grappling with tough challenges that simply refuse to go away after many concerted efforts. According to Mr Nnamdi Okafor, the CEO, May & Baker Plc, the problems, which range from intense competition, low capacity utilization, serious faking and adulteration of original brands and even low buying power of customers, have been giving the industry a reputation of low profitability and return on investment.\r\n\r\nBut how does he intend to go through with these problems as the new helmsman of a 67-year-old healthcare institution?\r\n\r\n''I have my ideas on where I want to take the company which is also in tandem with the corporate vision.

Okafor said at an interactive session with media men, his first ever since assuming office, where he bared it all on his roadmap to take the company to its promised land. To him, the strength of any company is a reflection of the strength of its brands. ''So we intend to increase our support for our brands. We recognize that May & Baker is a strong brand and we shall continue to build on that strength'', he added.\r\n\r\nOkafor, a fellow of the Pharmaceutical Society of Nigeria(PSN) and the Nigerian Institute of Management (NIM) and an alumnus of the Lagos Business School, has been with May & Baker since 1985. He became the managing director of May & Baker Nigeria Plc on February 1, 2011 following the appointment of his predecessor, Dr Joseph Odumodu, as the Director-General of the Standards Organisation of Nigeria (SON).\r\n\r\nHe holds a Bachelor of Pharmacy degree from the then University of Ife, Ile-Ife (now Obafemi Awolowo University, Ife) as well as Master of Business Administration (MBA) in Marketing from ESUT Business School, Lagos. Commenting on the appointment of his former boss as SON Director General, he was full of praises for the man who put the company on a good pedestal for the 13 years.\r\n\r\nHis words: ''I want to put it on record that I inherited a good company.

''This we intend to accomplish by developing a strategic mindset, putting our business on a rapid, stable and sustainable growth path, building systems and processes that function seamlessly and developing appetite for stretch financial goals. We are already working on a new strategic plan which will form the new road map for our journey towards our vision.''\r\n\r\nIn this piece, he shed more light on how he intends to achieve this lofty ideals.\r\n\r\nExcerpts:\r\nBackground\r\nI became the managing director of May & Baker Nigeria Plc on February 1, 2011. As you are aware, the transition became necessary when our immediate past managing director, Dr Joseph Odumodu, was appointed the Director-General of the Standards Organisation of Nigeria (SON) by the President. I am not new to the May & Baker family, having spent the 25 years of my working life in the company. If anything, I can say with every sense of modesty that I am indeed on a familiar terrain having also been on the board of this company as executive director for the past eight years.\r\n\r\nMy participation in the management of this company over these years has given me good knowledge of the business and will help me avoid past mistakes in trying to chart a new course for the company. However, it has its potential pitfall which is a tendency to perpetrate status quo. I can however assure you that the latter will not be the case here.\r\n\r\nThis is because the first thing I did on assumption of this new role is to reset my clock to my first day at work in May & Baker. This is to enable me see opportunities for change. It is clear to me that the only way to move this business to a new level is by implementing change through injection of new ideas and ways of doing things. So we will implement change. But we shall not implement change for the sake of change, we will only implement changes that will enhance our processes, business results and ultimately shareholder value.\r\n\r\nVision\r\nI want to put it on record the fact that I inherited a good company. Our former managing director did a fantastic job in his 22 years of service to this company, 13 of which were spent at the helm of affairs. He navigated this company through its most turbulent years and put it on a sound pedestal with impressive revenue and profit growth, robust asset base and strong corporate reputation. So we are standing on a solid ground and are very proud of what he accomplished.\r\n\r\nOn this note, permit me to give you an outline of my vision for the company and the strategic direction of the new management. May and Baker has a corporate vision which is ''To Be Among the Top 10 Conglomerates in Nigeria by 2020''. That vision remains unchanged because we believe it is the best we can have at this time. It was the collective decision of the management team taken at a strategic retreat three years ago and we shall vigorously pursue this dream.\r\n\r\nHowever, I have my ideas on where I want to take the company which is also in tandem with the corporate vision. We want to take this good company that has been handed over to us and turn it into a great company. A truly strong and stable world-class company powered by strong global brands, aggressive business diversification, optimum business process efficiency and good corporate governance principles.\r\n\r\nTo me the strength of a company is a reflection of the strength of its brands. So we intend to increase our support for our brands.\r\n\r\nWe recognize that May & Baker is a strong brand and we shall continue to build on that strength. However we also recognize that this equity is only strong with the older generation. Therefore we will deliberately target the younger generation with products and corporate social responsibility initiatives that will appeal to their lifestyle. Our strategic intent is to make May & Baker one of the fastest growing and profitable businesses in it''s category.\r\n\r\nThis we intend to accomplish by; developing a strategic mindset, putting our business on a rapid, stable and sustainable growth path, building systems and processes that function seamlessly and developing appetite for stretch financial goals. We are already working on a new strategic plan which will form the new road map for our journey towards our vision. This plan will be unveiled in the next three months and guide all our subsequent investments and resource deployment.\r\n\r\nCSR\r\nIn May & Baker we have supported the society through various sponsorships and donations to individuals, professional groups, governmental and non-governmental bodies. We intend to move a step further by being a credible source of information on public health and safety education, awareness and disease prevention. To achieve these objectives we are interested in partnering with societies and groups that invest in social wellbeing\r\n\r\nNew plant\r\nAs some of you are aware, May & Baker started a new pharmaceutical plant in Ota in 2008. It is a world class plant designed to blaze the trail in Nigeria as the country''s first WHO pre-Qualified pharmaceutical facility. This feat is meant to be not only a corporate accomplishment but also a national achievement. With it, Nigeria will be recording another first in West and Central Africa because the plant would be the first of its kind in these sub-regions. When fully certified by the WHO, the pharma plant in Ota will open a gateway to international business as well as help conserve the country''s foreign exchange in the area of drugs. This facility will be open to both local and international drug procuring entities who currently buy from Western and Asian manufacturers.\r\n\r\nThe facility, which has taken investment in excess of N3 billion, is now near completion and will have a capacity of about 30 billion tablets and 25 million bottles per annum working only two eight-hour shifts per day. This, in addition to our current capacities at the Ikeja factory, will represent a significant percentage of Nigeria''s drug requirement. The successful take-off of this plant in a short time is a major objective of the new management. In the years ahead we shall remain focused while playing on high stakes. We have plans to take full advantage of new openings in the economy and shall vigorously pursue opportunities in the export business especially within the West African sub region under the common external tariff programme of ECOWAS.\r\n\r\nWHO certification\r\nWe are not the only company in Nigeria that is going for the World Health Organization (WHO) certification . But I believe that we have the best chance of getting it because we have the best chance of getting it because we have the best facility. The process of getting WHO certification is a long process. It takes up to 18 months. It is a long process of documentation and it is also a political process. We are working very hard to get it in record time and I want to also say that NAFDAC is doing a very good job in this area by trying to assist companies which are ready to collaborate with WHO. We are going to Geneva next month(April) for a workshop meant to open up an avenue where drug manufacturers would interact with WHO officials who are in charge of this process.\r\n\r\nThat will facilitate the time frame for achieving it.\r\n\r\nChallenges\r\nYou know, the new plant is a very massive project. And I would say that we underestimated what would be involved. And as the project gets towards completion stage, we have challenges. So we have challenges with some of our contractors who started appealing for reviews and reviews. And at some point, we could not continue to grant such requests. So we have to change the main contractor who was working on the project. And in doing so, we lost some months-about two or three months. But I want to reassure you that that factory will start test running by the end of this month (March). We should be ready to start running on some products by the end of this month. And before the end of half year, we should officially commission that facility.\r\n\r\nThe year 2011 promises to be a very uncertain year for business generally. The reasons among others include the April general elections, adverse weather conditions in Asia and impact on food prices, revolution in the Middle East and impact on crude oil supply and prices and the overall impact of all these on inflation and purchasing power of an average Nigerian. As you are all aware, the pharmaceutical industry has been challenged over the years by various issues ranging from intense competition, low capacity utilization, serious faking and adulteration of original brands and even low buying power of customers.\r\n\r\nThis has given the industry a reputation of low profitability and return on investment. However at May and Baker Nigeria PLC, rather than being deterred by these negative signals, we have decided to drive our business and have performed above industry average. Our key strategies for higher performance in 2011 include stronger support for our brands especially our foods brand Mimee Noodles, broadening of our products offering and expected increase in output following commissioning of our Ota plant.\r\n\r\nWe are embarking on various expansion projects to deliver an enviable company for all. What we promise the shareholders is that we shall continue to make their investments in our company worthwhile by ensuring that they enjoy the benefits accruable from a strong entity in terms of returns on investment, capital appreciation and security of investment. We intend to excite our shareholders with more robust dividends.\r\n\r\nProducts\r\nCrunch Mee is still in the market but I must say it is not doing as much as we have wanted. The reason is that consumers seem not to like the way it is presented. People want it to be in form that would be easier for them to manage. At some point, we had to change its flavour and in that way improve its acceptability. We are in the process of reformulating it. But for it to get to the level that we want , the form will have to change and that will also involve some capital expenses. And because we are struggling to finish the one that we are doing, we are not in a hurry to put in money in buying machines for now. Mimee too is not out of the market.\r\n\r\nWe are very much in the market. Mimee is also not operating at 100 per cent capacity. We still have some spare capacity. What is happening is that that industry has full capacity. Some people came in, Dangote came in, Flourmills came in, Honeywell has been there. So we have a lot of capacity. In fact, Dangote built three factories and as I talk to you now, only one is functioning. The other two are down because the operators in the industry, unfortunately, are not expanding demand at the pace in which capacity was going up. There is some tough competition going on. That is why we have decided to, on our own, do something about demand. Very soon, we are going to be breaking our new campaign. And that campaign, I believe, is meant to sensitise the consumers and to get more people to try Mimee.\r\n\r\nAdulteration\r\nI am aware that some 10 years ago, this was a very bad situation because it was being done on two fronts: One, people were doing their own here and some were going outside Nigeria to also adulterate or fake these products. NAFDAC has done a lot to stem the tide. I would say that the incidence of adulteration has significantly come down. However, we still have issues of products being faked from time to time. I know we have encountered some of our products that were faked outside the country and brought in. And what we did was to quickly get in touch with NAFDAC.\r\n\r\nAnd working with NAFDAC, we were able to round up some of the parties that were involved in it because it was a very big cartel. What we have to do was trying to apply the break to whatever they had done and possibly confiscate the items. But beyond that, the legal system is a bit difficult to go through and we were not being prepared to go the whole hog of trying to imprison the people behind these things. But we just want to keep them uncomfortable and ensure that we dissuade them from continuing.\r\n\r\nOn the issue of faking, if you have followed the trend of the fakers, you will find out that they are evolving. One of the initiatives that we have also subscribed to is the use of identification code for the products. A lot of the products that can easily be faked would have some codes that people can pick up, and send SMS to a particular number and then get confirmation whether such product is genuine or not. As I said, the fakers are evolving, this is technology. For now, I am not sure they have been able to beat that particular system. So we are adopting it. And we keep looking at better ways to handle such situation.\r\n\r\nLiabilities\r\nIt is true that when you inherit assets, you also inherit liabilities. We know the environment that we are operating in and we know that everything is not rosy. And as business, we have liabilities. Of course, the first one is the fact that we need to build stronger brand as a company because that would help us to weather the storm, I mean when there is shock and withstand that shock in the system. If you have very strong brand, you will be able to withstand it.\r\n\r\nOf course, the fact that we are building a factory and we are borrowing money, we will also be paying interest on these funds. And what that means is that it would put some pressure on cash to run the business. That is one area that I am looking at with the Finance Director. That is what I can say for now. We will continue to improve on the good job that the past MD did. And there is always room for improvement.\r\n\r\nFuture plan\r\nWe are set to intensify our drive for rapid business expansion and diversification. We have already concluded plans to deepen our activities in current markets and enter new markets with new exciting products through parent and subsidiary companies. We are also at the verge of expanding our activities into new geographic markets including aggressive Inroads into export markets. We have in place established processes, procedures, policies and control systems that have guided our operations. Notwithstanding that these systems are working satisfactorily, we intend to look at some of them again with a view to making them more efficient. So we intend to continually fine tune our systems, processes and procedures for higher efficiency and better results.\r\n\r\nOur work force remains our most valuable assets. We are proud to have a rare assemblage of highly qualified and dedicated staff. This is made possible because May & Baker has a highly transparent recruitment process that ensures that only people who demonstrate the right competencies, mental and psychological disposition are employed. We shall provide the right environment and training for these talents to blossom into world class work force. We intend to adopt best practices in corporate governance. We shall run the business with the highest level of integrity and compliance with all relevant laws and regulations.\r\n\r\nAdvice\r\nOne thing that I want to say is that we are lucky as a country that we are exporting crude oil. So when the price of this crude oil goes up in the international market, and now that the Niger Delta situation is a bit under control, what this means is that we are going to export more crude; we are going to earn more revenue. The only thing that I would like to request is that the way this money is utilized will make a whole lot of difference.\r\n\r\nAs against what happens now, I mean the sharing of the money among the states and nobody can really accounts for what comes out of the extra windfall, the Federal Government should try to use this money to improve on infrastructure. Because a lot of people in the country are doing nothing because there is no power. For instance , imagine that we have 24 hours power supply, a lot of people will be working and also generate income for themselves. And that would reduce the difficulties that people are facing. It is important that government applies whatever resources(at its disposal) well.\r\n\r\nAnd like what is happening in some countries, food is very critical. The Federal Government should continue with what they are doing, which is subsidizing inputs of agriculture, which is important. And if it is possible, like it is being done in other parts of the world, subsidise some critical commodities like flour. The cost of flour has gone up and Nigerians like bread a lot. This means that they have to pay more for it. I think that the government should step in for such important items to see how the cost can be put under control.

(79, 'Prospect for Nigeria’s pharmaceutical industry ', 'The health needs of a nation reflect on certain essential medicines consumed by the populace. With the determining factor in the pharmaceutical business dependent on increasing disease pattern, over-the-counter (OTC) medicines such as analgesics, antimalarials and multivitamins make up a large share of the Nigerian market. Painkillers, also known as analgesics or antipyretics, have the largest market share of therapeutic classes of medicines locally produced due to their affordability, availability and widespread use for a wide range of symptoms.\r\n\r\nThis revelation, contained in a recent document review of the nation’s pharmaceutical sector tagged “Global United Nations Industrial Development Organisation (UNIDO) Project”, shows that analgesics constitute 25 percent of drugs produced in the country. Others include antibiotics (15 percent), multivitamins + haematinics (15 percent), antimalarial medicines (14 percent), antihypertensives (8 percent), cough and cold preparations (5 percent), antiretroviral medicines (6 percent), external/topical preparations (5 percent), antiTB medicines (4 percent), and others (3 percent).\r\n\r\nThe report shows that the existing large market size, strong demand and the need for management of infectious diseases, especially HIV/AIDS, malaria, TB, and neglected childhood diseases constitute enormous opportunity for pharmaceutical firms to produce therapeutic drugs to meet the health needs of Nigerians.\r\n\r\nCurrently, Nigeria is responsible for about 60 percent of medicines consumed in the ECOWAS by volume, underlining the huge sub-regional market of an estimated 600 million people, according to Pharmaceutical Manufacturing Group, Manufacturers’ Association of Nigeria (PMG-MAN). Trade incentives introduced by ECOWAS for pharmaceuticals within West Africa are helping to promote movement of pharmaceuticals within the sub-region, experts believe. Furthermore, the West African Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association (WAPMA) is working to enhance confidence in the quality of medicines produced locally and promote business in the sub-region.\r\n\r\nEstimates of the size of the nation’s pharmaceutical market vary. Business Monitor International (BMI) in 2009 estimated Nigeria’s pharmaceutical market at $600 million. Out of this figure, BMI attributes the largest share of $418 million to generic medicines, $121 million to OTC products, and $61 million to patented products.\r\n\r\nEqually, Frost & Sullivan, a growing partnership company, estimated a pharmaceutical market value of $740 million in 2009. Out of this figure, $266.4 million was attributed to generic medicines, $177.6 million to branded products, and $296 million to OTC products.\r\n\r\nDrug manufacturers in the country are faced with several constraints, including low capacity utilisation, under-capitalisation, a weak financial base, high production costs, as well as difficulty in meeting WHO prequalification criteria.\r\n\r\nHowever, with some pharmaceutical firms such as Evans, SWIPHA, CHI Pharmaceuticals, May and Baker, and Fidson Healthcare plc in the process of upgrading and/or building new facilities in preparation to meet these prequalification requirements, we believe this development will promote local production, given the increased opportunity to participate in international tenders, such as WHO, United Nations Children Fund (UNICEF), United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), UNITAID and the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, TB and Malaria. No doubt, WHO prequalification will help the nation to become self-sufficient in the manufacture of essential medicines, which will invariably have multiplier effects on the economy with creation of thousands of jobs and more foreign exchange earnings for the country.\r\n\r\nNigeria can learn from the India experience. The emergence of India’s pharmaceutical industry on the global landscape as a strong generics player allowed only process patents in pharmaceutical products. This development kept the cost of medicines at affordable levels by enabling domestic pharmaceutical firms to build technical expertise in reverse engineering of existing medicines by modifying the manufacturing process, thereby becoming efficient producers of generic drugs.', 9, '2013-09-26 09:53:39', 0, NULL, NULL),

With such funds, she explained, the Council could institutionalize the drugs distribution channels in the country.\r\n\r\n  “Another advantage we can derive from such funds is, we will now have more indigenous companies manufacturing what we consume. If indigenous companies are the ones manufacturing then we can do what is called marketing surveillance.

The aim is to encourage young and not-so-young professionals in the diaspora who are trying to make the decision of whether to move back to Nigeria. In collaboration with the brilliant team at MoveBackToNigeria.com, we hope to bring you a weekly interview with individuals who have successfully made the leap. The idea is to share their successes and their challenges as they made the decision.\r\n\r\nA lot of Nigerians in the diaspora have questions about making a change at home in Nigeria. Many suggest really good ideas on how to make things better; others would like to contribute to making a difference back home but are just not sure where to begin.\r\n\r\nThis week, we excitedly bring you a feature on a young Nigerian pharmacist (he  has chosen to remain anonymous) who is moving back to Nigeria to pursue his dreams in the health sector and beyond. Read on, to hear him talk about his career so far, his hopes and plans for his pharmaceutical practice and his take on the pharmaceutical industry in Nigeria. We hope you enjoy reading his story.\r\n\r\nThanks for agreeing to speak to us. Could you kindly tell us who you are?\r\nI’m a young Nigerian pharmacist, living and working in London, England and looking to move back to Nigeria in the next few months. My interests range from sports to music and everything in between.\r\n\r\nWhen did you leave Nigeria and why?\r\nI left Nigeria for the UK in 2001 for educational reasons.\r\n\r\nCan you shed some light on these educational reasons?\r\nSure. I left Nigeria after secondary school to do my A Levels in the UK and subsequently attend university there as well.  I studied pharmacy at Cardiff University and graduated with a Masters in Pharmacy.\r\n\r\nDid you always know you wanted to be a pharmacist?\r\nNot necessarily. Whilst I was proficient in science subjects, I was not always sure of what science I wanted to practice. My dad then decided on pharmacy and I’m happy to say it’s turned out to be a worthy decision.\r\n\r\nThat’s certainly fortunate. So how did your career in pharmacy begin?\r\nWell, it’s a seemingly convoluted path so do bear with me as I narrate. In the UK, after studying pharmacy, there’s a 1 year mandatory ‘pre-registration’ program (similar to the housemanship in medicine) which involves 1 year of working, shadowing a pharmacist and a very challenging professional exam afterwards. I undertook mine at Tesco Pharmacy, thankfully passed the exams and then registered as a pharmacist in the UK. I then went back to Cardiff University for another Masters degree, this time in Strategic Marketing as I felt that my business skills were lacking and I needed to remedy that. This I did for long term reasons because, I knew I would one day be going back to Nigeria to set up a pharmacy and I wanted to have the entrepreneurial skills necessary to market my drugs. After this degree, I got a job at Superdrug which lasted only briefly as the visa rules got changed and so I had to prematurely leave the UK for Nigeria.\r\n\r\nAlthough I was somewhat disillusioned at the prospect, I decided to use the opportunity to undertake the NYSC program. However, when I got home, I realised that I was misinformed about the NYSC procedure, particularly as it applies to graduates of medicine and pharmacy. You have to register as a pharmacist and then take a 6week course which is rotated nationwide and runs once annually, before being eligible for NYSC. I had unfortunately arrived months before the course and did not relish the prospect of waiting idly which led me to decide to come back to the UK for a third Masters degree, this time in Global Affairs at the University of Buckingham. I did this alongside a part-time pharmacist job in Boots and I stayed with them, even after the completion of my course while planning another move back to Nigeria; this time much more thought out and researched. After Boots, a better opportunity presented itself at Sainsbury’s Pharmacy and I took it and that’s where I currently work as the pharmacy manager.\r\n\r\nYou’ve mentioned a few times, your unwavering intent to return to Nigeria. Why this mindset?\r\nMoving back to Nigeria should be a decision based on personal circumstances. After all is said and done and despite the very well documented infrastructural and societal challenges in Nigeria, there’s still nowhere like home. I have a very good job in the UK and live a comfortable life but I feel that going home now is the right thing to do, for me.  I would like to be closer to my family, most of whom reside there and I would also like to set up my pharmacy practice in Nigeria, God willing. It is where I want to be and where I am happiest.\r\n\r\nWhilst I’m there, the intent is to get some hands on work experience, register my company and prepare for NYSC. Another reason is that there is a huge influx of pharmacists into the UK and so the money is not even what it used to be. The sector here is also getting very saturated for instance, because of EU laws, pharmacists from eastern Europe can come to the UK, shadow a pharmacist for a month and then get their license irrespective of whatever sort of training (or not) they may received in their home countries.\r\n\r\nThat’s understandable. You have discussed setting up your Pharmacy in Nigeria, can you go into some detail and tell us what this would entail?\r\nMy background in pharmacy and business has prepared me for this and it is something I want to do for a myriad of reasons. Operating a small, retail pharmacy is a profitable venture, it is also one that by its very nature will meet a very basic human need as I plan to site it close to schools, hospitals and potentially also specialise in certain medication(s), be a distributor, supplying private and public establishments and much more. I’m very optimistic about moving back and while I am very aware that things don’t always turn out as planned, particularly in the uncertain Nigerian terrain, I’m just hoping for the best.\r\n\r\nThis naturally leads us to the pharmaceutical industry in Nigeria and bodies like PCN & NAFDAC. What are your thoughts regarding these regulatory bodies?\r\nThe pharmaceutical industry in Nigeria is definitely progressing.  However, I feel we need to start manufacturing more medicines in Nigeria. The obvious infrastructural challenges certainly pose obstacles to this but it’s an area that should be better explored. We need more companies like Emzor, Orange Drugs and so on as a lot of medicines are currently imported from India and China which is not the route I would personally take if given the opportunity. There is more that can be done to increase our production especially considering we have the raw materials in abundance and a good example of this is maize starch which is a major component of most medicines.\r\n\r\nThe regulatory agencies like NAFDAC (National Agency for Food & Drug Administration and Control) and PCN (Pharmacists Council of Nigeria) need to be empowered and constitutionalized so as to be more effective and also to eliminate the crippling bureaucracy.  There are existing policies which go a long way towards curbing illegal practices. Many people are not aware of the existing industry rules and this is due to the fact that they are hardly enforced. One such rule is one in which if a businessman wants to set up a pharmacy, there must an in-house pharmacist who must own at least 40% of the business so as to ensure best practice. The PCN also needs to organise more public enlightenment campaigns for citizens to be aware of the laws and policies. For instance medication like Valium and Lexotan by law are prescription only in Nigeria but a lot of people flout these stipulations.\r\n\r\nWhat unique opportunities exist in the industry for people who may also be considering a move back?\r\nThere are many opportunities that abound, just take the size of Nigeria into consideration. There are 36 states in Nigeria with each one presenting a unique opportunity to whoever is interested and with the wherewithal to power the interest. For instance, I know someone who lives in Delta State but chooses to travel to the neighbouring Edo State to purchase medication for her kids when the need arises. There might be pharmacies close to her but she chooses to go all the way and it may be a function of the origin of the drugs sold by the pharmacies. She may just prefer European brands such as GSK or Roche to the Asian brands which are what abound in Nigeria and so here exists an opportunity for a business venture. Also, the WHO states that the fake drugs market In Africa is worth millions of dollars and we have a lot of people coming in from neighbouring countries like Ghana and Cameroon to buy medicines in Nigeria and so this is another opportunity to come in and present an ethical and alternative change.\r\n\r\nThis is all very enlightening and you’re clearly very passionate about this cause. Where then, do you see yourself and potentially, your pharmacy in 3 to 5 years?\r\nHopefully in a stable and successful position.  I intend to eventually expand and open more branches of my pharmacy as well as be a key player in the sector. I have already started the legwork and so with hard work and God’s blessings, the sky is just the foundation.\r\n\r\nThat’s certainly positive. On a final note and as you’re somewhat in the transition process, what would you say to people considering a similar move?\r\nYou need to know before you go. Do not just make hasty decisions. I see a lot of people you’ve interviewed on the MoveBackToNigeria.com website who’ve successfully made the move back home are either in the finance sector or the engineering sector and that’s understandable as those sectors are currently enjoying a boom. It is not the same for the health sector and anyone who does not do sufficient research will most likely encounter problems. Doctors are not doing so well back home except those who run their own clinics.\r\n\r\nAnother point to remember is that you need to be open-minded and not compare Nigerian systems to those in the west. It’s also important to be patient and hardworking and eventually, things should pay off.\r\n\r\n Thank you very much for your time and best wishes moving forward.', 4, '2013-09-26 09:53:39', 0, NULL, NULL),
(89, '\r\nCan Nigeria’s manufacturing, pharmaceutical industry compete? (2) – Prof.Soludo', 'The former Central Bank governor, Prof. Charles Soludo in a recent forum organised by Nigeria Association of Industrial Pharmacists (NAIP) in Lagos, has questioned the ability of Nigeria’s manufacturing and pharmaceutical industry to compete in the global market with certain indices pointing to that direction.\r\n\r\nAs I review the global industry, the structural shifts and market trends, I do not have good news for the audience here. I refer specifically to the pharmaceutical manufacturers among your membership. As of today, Nigeria has neither a comparative nor a competitive advantage in pharmaceuticals.\r\n\r\n(To deliberately create a competitive advantage will require serious strategizing and effort). On cost considerations, Nigerian firms cannot compete: the risk-adjusted rate of return on investment in the industry is comparatively very low. It is not surprising that the global majors in the industry are not pouring in capital. Estimated at about US$l,billion (less than 0.5% of Nigeria’s GDP and basically the size of a medium-sized pharmaceutical company abroad) the share of Nigeria’s, pharmaceutical industry in the global industry is basically zero.\r\n\r\nLocal manufacfure has been consistently losing market shares in the local market let alone being competitive in the international market. I understand that todate, none of the pharmaceutical companies in Nigeria is WHO- certified. If you adjust for the outsourced production to foreign firms, the 100 or so largely small and fragmented companies in the industry account for about 20% of domestic drug consumption.\r\n\r\nIt is a struggling industry. Some of the existing firms have resorted to a number of ‘survivalist strategies’ by joining the ‘trading train – as marketers for foreign firms or have outsourced their production to Indian and Chinese manufacturers while, they are more amply rewarded as happy importers. I will not be surprised if out of your 300 corporate members, more than 60% are in the marketing/distribution segment.\r\n\r\nI will not waste your time with a rehearsal of why and how the industry is not competitive. You probably have a better list of the reasons. The bottomline is that it is subject to the same competitive disadvantages as the productive sector especially manufacturing.\r\n\r\nThe industry cannot withstand the drug armada from China and India in particular – which have by far better cost advantages – and you cannot stop them from coming given our obligations under the General Agreement on Trade and Tariffs (GATT) and the World Trade Organization (WTO). Some of you complain that the industry is a victim of unfair trade (characterized by inflow of fake, illegal, substandard drugs or even ‘dumping’) while the government does little to ‘protect’ or patronize the industry.\r\n\r\nSome demand for special, cheaper funds for pharmaceuticals production. The list is long. I will argue that some of the proposals, if implemented, will merely act as short to medium term palliatives. In your language, administering only pain killers to a patient with malaria will not make him well.\r\n\r\nWhere do we go from here?\r\n\r\nSome analysts believe that the national development discourse is saddled with creeping analysis paralysis.\r\n\r\nPhilosophers, it is said, have interpreted the world: the problem is to change it! As I review the National Economic Empowerment and Development Strategy – NEEDS – or its revised version in the name of Vision 2020 document, the various ‘conclusions’ of the annual Nigerian Economic Summit, and the sundry ‘blueprints’ f1ying around you almost come to the conclusion that the missing link is a focused execution capacity.\r\n', 15, '2013-09-26 09:53:39', 0, NULL, NULL),

But the contrary reality by these research findings may hold critical lessons for Nigeria and other countries with strong dependence and increased public confidence in foreign medical supplies for the day to day management of domestic healthcare problems.\r\n\r\nFor instance, when a call was made in April 2012 by NAFDAC that a 200 billion naira Pharmaceutical Intervention Fund be established in Nigeria, the idea was viewed by many people as financially expensive. According to official statements, the proposed Fund would be used in\r\nfinancing loans to local pharmaceutical firms in order to enhance their capacity for more production or possible expansion. Yet, the idea received some resentment from a section of the Nigerian masses.\r\n\r\nBut this critical report by American researchers may become a strong reason for most of them to now reconsider their respective positions on the matter, particularly as the nations on which Nigeria depends for health safety are being linked with consumer risks and other regulatory challenges.\r\n\r\nOn July 26, 2000, the Journal of the American Medical Association (Vol. 284, No. 4) reported that, every day, 290 people are killed by prescription drugs approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration, FDA. The report was authored by Dr. Barbara Starfield (MD, MPH) of the Johns Hopkins School of Hygiene and Public Health, who also placed the annual figure for deaths from the adverse effects of FDA-approved prescription medications at 106, 000 people.\r\n\r\nWith this manner of scary statistics from reputable medical sources, the regulation of consumer imports in Nigeria deserves to be treated as an urgent matter of national security. In order to achieve this, there must be a clearly laid_out plan to increase local production of pharmaceutical goods and enhance proportional reduction in the amount of imported medical supplies.\r\n\r\nAlready, there are favourable conditions for achieving this, but the Nigerian government seems to be going slow in this direction. Recently, the World Health Organization, WHO, certified Pan African Foundation, PAF, as a potential beneficiary of the NAFDAC-proposed Fund.  PAF is a Nigerian disposable syringe manufacturing company based in Port Harcourt, and was one among 11 other companies selected by NAFDAC for the WHO prequalification exercise. The company won a place alongside more others in South Africa, Uganda and Morocco, thus completing a list of seven companies endorsed by experts from US and the European Union.\r\n\r\nIn technical terms, a pre_qualification by WHO gives pharmaceutical companies the franchise of marketing their products worldwide. If PAF succeeds to function this way, it will not only strengthen the nation’s arm of consumer safety but also boost its revenue base.\r\n\r\nHowever, without a swift reaction to the NAFDAC-proposed Fund, Nigeria may only be sitting on her prospects in the sustainable management of its healthcare sector.\r\n\r\n*Mr.  Ikyaa, a commentator on national issues, wrote from Abuja.', 15, '2013-09-26 09:53:39', 0, NULL, NULL),
(91, '\r\nAppraising Nigeria’s need for a pharmaceutical intervention fund', 'Mr. Lolu Ojo, Chief Executive Officer of Merit HealthCare Limited and Chairman of the Nigerian Association of Industrial Pharmacists (NAIP) in this interview with BEN NDUBUWA spoke on the need for government to help the pharmaceutical industry grow through  patronage as well as putting in place policies to check the incidence of fake drugs.\r\n\r\nWhat are the challenges facing the pharmaceutical industry?\r\n\r\nThe challenges of the pharmaceutical industry in Nigeria are myriad just like every other sector of the economy. First we do not have a conducive environment to operate in. The truth is that the environment is hostile to business growth and development. However, we are determined and we have charged our people to rise above the harsh economic environment.  We believe that as the day goes by, we will survive and give thanks to God.\r\n\r\nWhat more can you say in an environment where you generate your own electricity, build your borehole for water, pay for security, build your roads and drainage, among others. For instance, in the past one month or so, we had no light because some vandals stole the cable from the transformer. So, everyday, we run the generator to keep the business going. For me this is one of the greatest challenges.\r\n\r\nAgain, as you are probably aware, 70 per cent of all the pharmaceutical products consumed in this country are actually imported. Therefore, any swing in the foreign exchange rate directly impact on our businesses. If, for instance, you had made an order for some products and there is a change in the exchange rate that is not favourable you will be in trouble. This is an economy where you cannot increase price arbitrarily because the customer is already complaining of the old price not being affordable.\r\n\r\n The upward swing in exchange rate, which had been our lot in the past few years, erodes our margin and limit our ability to expand, upgrade facilities, employ more people, take risks/higher challenges, etc. More so, banks’ interest rate is not better. It is the most unfriendly compared to what happens in other climes. We pay as much as 25 per cent or more.  The high cost of production is quite challenging.\r\n\r\nSome of our colleagues, including myself, are into importation not necessarily because we want to but more because it offers a more convenient platform to start business. I would have preferred to be in manufacturing and we have decided that, no matter what it is going to cost, we will start our own production soon. The fear all over the place is that of inadequate power supply. For instance, if your production line is busy producing and all of a sudden the power goes off and assuming my generator is faulty, the worst that will happen to me as an importer is the inconveniences of not being able to use the computer systems or the office, but, it is not the same for a manufacturer. The loss would be enormous.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nAs chairman of NAIP, what do you intend to achieve?\r\n\r\nNAIP is a technical arm of the Pharmaceutical Society of Nigeria (PSN). The members of NAIP are those pharmacists who are not in the hospitals, community pharmacy practice, or in the academia. We have a lot of pharmacists in the banks, in telecommunications, in the oil industry and other areas.  \r\n\r\n As a group, we are stronger and able to speak with bigger and louder voice and we can mobilise our members and engage in those things that will favour them. As a body, whether you are manufacturing, marketing or other forms of industrial pharmacy, the important thing is that we come together instead of having a cacophony of voices. That way, we have resemblance of orderliness and one voice.\r\n\r\nJust recently, we had a stakeholders’ meeting to streamline the process of handling product complaints. Not only that, just like any other association, we can call ourselves to order and we can call companies to order as well. If pharmacists that are working with companies and are not doing well, we call them to order. We have handled so many cases like that. We also work on development, For instance, we have set up a business academy called ‘NAIP Business Academy’.\r\n\r\nIt is a training institution and the objective is to fill the skill and knowledge gaps that we have observed in the industry. When we started as sales representative, we were trained for up to three to four months. This is hardly the case now. So, it has become imperative that the Association should set up such an institution for our members.\r\n\r\nIt is unfortunate the some multinationals that we take pleasure in condemning are the ones that took extra time to train us before allowing us to go to the field. This institution is to take care of this gap created by the exit of some of these companies.  Unfortunately, the multinationals left because of the difficult operating environment. The Pfizer, Bayer, Roche, etc, they all left Nigeria then, though they are coming back but not as big as they were before their exit. Most of them now have a simple marketing office in the country.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nWhat Is attracting the multinationals back?\r\n\r\nYou cannot ignore Nigeria. The whole world is looking towards Nigeria as the next place for investment. Do you know what is happening in America and Europe now? Africa and Nigeria is surely the next destination for investment. You cannot ignore 160 million people. I learnt about the assertion of the CEO of Shoprite if as it is being widely circulated that 60 percent of Nigerians are living below poverty level, the remaining 40 percent that are probably above the poverty line is more than the population of South Africa.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nHow is your relationship with NAFDAC?         \r\n\r\nOur relationship with NAFDAC is normal but not optimal. I sincerely hope that before the end of my tenure as the national chairman of NAIP, the relationship will get better. I had actually led a delegation of NAIP members to the DG of NAFDAC’s office to declare our support and readiness to work with the agency. As a gentle man, he is good; his intentions are genuine and altruistic. There is need for more contact.\r\n\r\n A delegation of PSN recently met the DG and it was agreed that we need to interact more irrespective our differences for the good of the nation. Unfortunately, I could not attend that meeting because of other pressing and earlier scheduled NAIP assignment. We need to discuss and agree on issues and interventions in a free atmosphere before execution. Some issues or interventions like anti-faking devices, etc need the support of everybody for success.\r\n\r\nNAFDAC is a regulating institution and not a ‘strangulator’. The pharmaceutical industry form more than 80 per cent of NAFDAC’s clientele base. Therefore, we need each other for the sector to be vibrant. It is to our interest for a regulatory body like NAFDAC to be vibrant and alive to her responsibilities.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nHow do you feel about fake drugs coming from Asian countries?    \r\n\r\nUntil we change our attitude it will continue. The people bringing in fake drugs are Nigerians. Whether it is Musa, Okechukwu, Laolu or Ekaitte the thing is that they are Nigerians. There is nothing wrong with India or China. All the products you see on the shelves in Europe and America are from China and India; these drugs are made there because the cost of production is low. It is our people that go to tell these people don’t worry instead of 250 mg make it 50mg and label it 250mg and ship it to me I will sell them. What we tell our people is that they should buy from the right source.', 5, '2013-09-26 09:53:39', 0, NULL, NULL),

As you are aware, the transition became necessary when our immediate past managing director, Dr Joseph Odumodu, was appointed the Director-General of the Standards Organisation of Nigeria (SON) by the President. I am not new to the May & Baker family, having spent the 25 years of my working life in the company. If anything, I can say with every sense of modesty that I am indeed on a familiar terrain having also been on the board of this company as executive director for the past eight years.\r\n\r\nMy participation in the management of this company over these years has given me good knowledge of the business and will help me avoid past mistakes in trying to chart a new course for the company. However, it has its potential pitfall which is a tendency to perpetrate status quo. I can however assure you that the latter will not be the case here.\r\n\r\nThis is because the first thing I did on assumption of this new role is to reset my clock to my first day at work in May & Baker. This is to enable me see opportunities for change. It is clear to me that the only way to move this business to a new level is by implementing change through injection of new ideas and ways of doing things. So we will implement change. But we shall not implement change for the sake of change, we will only implement changes that will enhance our processes, business results and ultimately shareholder value.\r\n\r\nVision\r\nI want to put it on record the fact that I inherited a good company. Our former managing director did a fantastic job in his 22 years of service to this company, 13 of which were spent at the helm of affairs. He navigated this company through its most turbulent years and put it on a sound pedestal with impressive revenue and profit growth, robust asset base and strong corporate reputation. So we are standing on a solid ground and are very proud of what he accomplished.\r\n\r\nOn this note, permit me to give you an outline of my vision for the company and the strategic direction of the new management. May and Baker has a corporate vision which is ''To Be Among the Top 10 Conglomerates in Nigeria by 2020''. That vision remains unchanged because we believe it is the best we can have at this time. It was the collective decision of the management team taken at a strategic retreat three years ago and we shall vigorously pursue this dream.\r\n\r\nHowever, I have my ideas on where I want to take the company which is also in tandem with the corporate vision. We want to take this good company that has been handed over to us and turn it into a great company. A truly strong and stable world-class company powered by strong global brands, aggressive business diversification, optimum business process efficiency and good corporate governance principles.\r\n\r\nTo me the strength of a company is a reflection of the strength of its brands. So we intend to increase our support for our brands.\r\n\r\nWe recognize that May & Baker is a strong brand and we shall continue to build on that strength. However we also recognize that this equity is only strong with the older generation. Therefore we will deliberately target the younger generation with products and corporate social responsibility initiatives that will appeal to their lifestyle. Our strategic intent is to make May & Baker one of the fastest growing and profitable businesses in it''s category.\r\n\r\nThis we intend to accomplish by; developing a strategic mindset, putting our business on a rapid, stable and sustainable growth path, building systems and processes that function seamlessly and developing appetite for stretch financial goals. We are already working on a new strategic plan which will form the new road map for our journey towards our vision. This plan will be unveiled in the next three months and guide all our subsequent investments and resource deployment.\r\n\r\nCSR\r\nIn May & Baker we have supported the society through various sponsorships and donations to individuals, professional groups, governmental and non-governmental bodies. We intend to move a step further by being a credible source of information on public health and safety education, awareness and disease prevention. To achieve these objectives we are interested in partnering with societies and groups that invest in social wellbeing\r\n\r\nNew plant\r\nAs some of you are aware, May & Baker started a new pharmaceutical plant in Ota in 2008. It is a world class plant designed to blaze the trail in Nigeria as the country''s first WHO pre-Qualified pharmaceutical facility. This feat is meant to be not only a corporate accomplishment but also a national achievement. With it, Nigeria will be recording another first in West and Central Africa because the plant would be the first of its kind in these sub-regions. When fully certified by the WHO, the pharma plant in Ota will open a gateway to international business as well as help conserve the country''s foreign exchange in the area of drugs. This facility will be open to both local and international drug procuring entities who currently buy from Western and Asian manufacturers.\r\n\r\nThe facility, which has taken investment in excess of N3 billion, is now near completion and will have a capacity of about 30 billion tablets and 25 million bottles per annum working only two eight-hour shifts per day. This, in addition to our current capacities at the Ikeja factory, will represent a significant percentage of Nigeria''s drug requirement. The successful take-off of this plant in a short time is a major objective of the new management. In the years ahead we shall remain focused while playing on high stakes. We have plans to take full advantage of new openings in the economy and shall vigorously pursue opportunities in the export business especially within the West African sub region under the common external tariff programme of ECOWAS.\r\n\r\nWHO certification\r\nWe are not the only company in Nigeria that is going for the World Health Organization (WHO) certification . But I believe that we have the best chance of getting it because we have the best chance of getting it because we have the best facility. The process of getting WHO certification is a long process. It takes up to 18 months. It is a long process of documentation and it is also a political process. We are working very hard to get it in record time and I want to also say that NAFDAC is doing a very good job in this area by trying to assist companies which are ready to collaborate with WHO. We are going to Geneva next month(April) for a workshop meant to open up an avenue where drug manufacturers would interact with WHO officials who are in charge of this process.\r\n\r\nThat will facilitate the time frame for achieving it.\r\n\r\nChallenges\r\nYou know, the new plant is a very massive project. And I would say that we underestimated what would be involved. And as the project gets towards completion stage, we have challenges. So we have challenges with some of our contractors who started appealing for reviews and reviews. And at some point, we could not continue to grant such requests. So we have to change the main contractor who was working on the project. And in doing so, we lost some months-about two or three months. But I want to reassure you that that factory will start test running by the end of this month (March). We should be ready to start running on some products by the end of this month. And before the end of half year, we should officially commission that facility.\r\n\r\nThe year 2011 promises to be a very uncertain year for business generally. The reasons among others include the April general elections, adverse weather conditions in Asia and impact on food prices, revolution in the Middle East and impact on crude oil supply and prices and the overall impact of all these on inflation and purchasing power of an average Nigerian. As you are all aware, the pharmaceutical industry has been challenged over the years by various issues ranging from intense competition, low capacity utilization, serious faking and adulteration of original brands and even low buying power of customers.\r\n\r\nThis has given the industry a reputation of low profitability and return on investment. However at May and Baker Nigeria PLC, rather than being deterred by these negative signals, we have decided to drive our business and have performed above industry average. Our key strategies for higher performance in 2011 include stronger support for our brands especially our foods brand Mimee Noodles, broadening of our products offering and expected increase in output following commissioning of our Ota plant.\r\n\r\nWe are embarking on various expansion projects to deliver an enviable company for all. What we promise the shareholders is that we shall continue to make their investments in our company worthwhile by ensuring that they enjoy the benefits accruable from a strong entity in terms of returns on investment, capital appreciation and security of investment. We intend to excite our shareholders with more robust dividends.\r\n\r\nProducts\r\nCrunch Mee is still in the market but I must say it is not doing as much as we have wanted. The reason is that consumers seem not to like the way it is presented. People want it to be in form that would be easier for them to manage. At some point, we had to change its flavour and in that way improve its acceptability. We are in the process of reformulating it. But for it to get to the level that we want , the form will have to change and that will also involve some capital expenses. And because we are struggling to finish the one that we are doing, we are not in a hurry to put in money in buying machines for now. Mimee too is not out of the market.\r\n\r\nWe are very much in the market. Mimee is also not operating at 100 per cent capacity. We still have some spare capacity. What is happening is that that industry has full capacity. Some people came in, Dangote came in, Flourmills came in, Honeywell has been there. So we have a lot of capacity. In fact, Dangote built three factories and as I talk to you now, only one is functioning. The other two are down because the operators in the industry, unfortunately, are not expanding demand at the pace in which capacity was going up. There is some tough competition going on. That is why we have decided to, on our own, do something about demand. Very soon, we are going to be breaking our new campaign. And that campaign, I believe, is meant to sensitise the consumers and to get more people to try Mimee.\r\n\r\nAdulteration\r\nI am aware that some 10 years ago, this was a very bad situation because it was being done on two fronts: One, people were doing their own here and some were going outside Nigeria to also adulterate or fake these products. NAFDAC has done a lot to stem the tide. I would say that the incidence of adulteration has significantly come down. However, we still have issues of products being faked from time to time. I know we have encountered some of our products that were faked outside the country and brought in. And what we did was to quickly get in touch with NAFDAC.\r\n\r\nAnd working with NAFDAC, we were able to round up some of the parties that were involved in it because it was a very big cartel. What we have to do was trying to apply the break to whatever they had done and possibly confiscate the items. But beyond that, the legal system is a bit difficult to go through and we were not being prepared to go the whole hog of trying to imprison the people behind these things. But we just want to keep them uncomfortable and ensure that we dissuade them from continuing.\r\n\r\nOn the issue of faking, if you have followed the trend of the fakers, you will find out that they are evolving. One of the initiatives that we have also subscribed to is the use of identification code for the products. A lot of the products that can easily be faked would have some codes that people can pick up, and send SMS to a particular number and then get confirmation whether such product is genuine or not. As I said, the fakers are evolving, this is technology. For now, I am not sure they have been able to beat that particular system. So we are adopting it. And we keep looking at better ways to handle such situation.\r\n\r\nLiabilities\r\nIt is true that when you inherit assets, you also inherit liabilities. We know the environment that we are operating in and we know that everything is not rosy. And as business, we have liabilities. Of course, the first one is the fact that we need to build stronger brand as a company because that would help us to weather the storm, I mean when there is shock and withstand that shock in the system. If you have very strong brand, you will be able to withstand it.\r\n\r\nOf course, the fact that we are building a factory and we are borrowing money, we will also be paying interest on these funds. And what that means is that it would put some pressure on cash to run the business. That is one area that I am looking at with the Finance Director. That is what I can say for now. We will continue to improve on the good job that the past MD did. And there is always room for improvement.\r\n\r\nFuture plan\r\nWe are set to intensify our drive for rapid business expansion and diversification. We have already concluded plans to deepen our activities in current markets and enter new markets with new exciting products through parent and subsidiary companies. We are also at the verge of expanding our activities into new geographic markets including aggressive Inroads into export markets. We have in place established processes, procedures, policies and control systems that have guided our operations. Notwithstanding that these systems are working satisfactorily, we intend to look at some of them again with a view to making them more efficient. So we intend to continually fine tune our systems, processes and procedures for higher efficiency and better results.\r\n\r\nOur work force remains our most valuable assets. We are proud to have a rare assemblage of highly qualified and dedicated staff. This is made possible because May & Baker has a highly transparent recruitment process that ensures that only people who demonstrate the right competencies, mental and psychological disposition are employed. We shall provide the right environment and training for these talents to blossom into world class work force. We intend to adopt best practices in corporate governance. We shall run the business with the highest level of integrity and compliance with all relevant laws and regulations.\r\n\r\nAdvice\r\nOne thing that I want to say is that we are lucky as a country that we are exporting crude oil. So when the price of this crude oil goes up in the international market, and now that the Niger Delta situation is a bit under control, what this means is that we are going to export more crude; we are going to earn more revenue. The only thing that I would like to request is that the way this money is utilized will make a whole lot of difference.\r\n\r\nAs against what happens now, I mean the sharing of the money among the states and nobody can really accounts for what comes out of the extra windfall, the Federal Government should try to use this money to improve on infrastructure. Because a lot of people in the country are doing nothing because there is no power. For instance , imagine that we have 24 hours power supply, a lot of people will be working and also generate income for themselves. And that would reduce the difficulties that people are facing. It is important that government applies whatever resources(at its disposal) well.\r\n\r\nAnd like what is happening in some countries, food is very critical. The Federal Government should continue with what they are doing, which is subsidizing inputs of agriculture, which is important. And if it is possible, like it is being done in other parts of the world, subsidise some critical commodities like flour. The cost of flour has gone up and Nigerians like bread a lot. This means that they have to pay more for it. I think that the government should step in for such important items to see how the cost can be put under control.

(95, 'Prospect for Nigeria’s pharmaceutical industry ', 'The health needs of a nation reflect on certain essential medicines consumed by the populace. With the determining factor in the pharmaceutical business dependent on increasing disease pattern, over-the-counter (OTC) medicines such as analgesics, antimalarials and multivitamins make up a large share of the Nigerian market. Painkillers, also known as analgesics or antipyretics, have the largest market share of therapeutic classes of medicines locally produced due to their affordability, availability and widespread use for a wide range of symptoms.\r\n\r\nThis revelation, contained in a recent document review of the nation’s pharmaceutical sector tagged “Global United Nations Industrial Development Organisation (UNIDO) Project”, shows that analgesics constitute 25 percent of drugs produced in the country. Others include antibiotics (15 percent), multivitamins + haematinics (15 percent), antimalarial medicines (14 percent), antihypertensives (8 percent), cough and cold preparations (5 percent), antiretroviral medicines (6 percent), external/topical preparations (5 percent), antiTB medicines (4 percent), and others (3 percent).\r\n\r\nThe report shows that the existing large market size, strong demand and the need for management of infectious diseases, especially HIV/AIDS, malaria, TB, and neglected childhood diseases constitute enormous opportunity for pharmaceutical firms to produce therapeutic drugs to meet the health needs of Nigerians.\r\n\r\nCurrently, Nigeria is responsible for about 60 percent of medicines consumed in the ECOWAS by volume, underlining the huge sub-regional market of an estimated 600 million people, according to Pharmaceutical Manufacturing Group, Manufacturers’ Association of Nigeria (PMG-MAN). Trade incentives introduced by ECOWAS for pharmaceuticals within West Africa are helping to promote movement of pharmaceuticals within the sub-region, experts believe. Furthermore, the West African Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association (WAPMA) is working to enhance confidence in the quality of medicines produced locally and promote business in the sub-region.\r\n\r\nEstimates of the size of the nation’s pharmaceutical market vary. Business Monitor International (BMI) in 2009 estimated Nigeria’s pharmaceutical market at $600 million. Out of this figure, BMI attributes the largest share of $418 million to generic medicines, $121 million to OTC products, and $61 million to patented products.\r\n\r\nEqually, Frost & Sullivan, a growing partnership company, estimated a pharmaceutical market value of $740 million in 2009. Out of this figure, $266.4 million was attributed to generic medicines, $177.6 million to branded products, and $296 million to OTC products.\r\n\r\nDrug manufacturers in the country are faced with several constraints, including low capacity utilisation, under-capitalisation, a weak financial base, high production costs, as well as difficulty in meeting WHO prequalification criteria.\r\n\r\nHowever, with some pharmaceutical firms such as Evans, SWIPHA, CHI Pharmaceuticals, May and Baker, and Fidson Healthcare plc in the process of upgrading and/or building new facilities in preparation to meet these prequalification requirements, we believe this development will promote local production, given the increased opportunity to participate in international tenders, such as WHO, United Nations Children Fund (UNICEF), United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), UNITAID and the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, TB and Malaria. No doubt, WHO prequalification will help the nation to become self-sufficient in the manufacture of essential medicines, which will invariably have multiplier effects on the economy with creation of thousands of jobs and more foreign exchange earnings for the country.\r\n\r\nNigeria can learn from the India experience. The emergence of India’s pharmaceutical industry on the global landscape as a strong generics player allowed only process patents in pharmaceutical products. This development kept the cost of medicines at affordable levels by enabling domestic pharmaceutical firms to build technical expertise in reverse engineering of existing medicines by modifying the manufacturing process, thereby becoming efficient producers of generic drugs.', 9, '2013-09-26 09:53:39', 0, NULL, NULL),

While commending the Kano State government for some talks towards that direction, with the pharmacists association in the state, the Acting Registrar of Pharmaceutical Council of Nigeria, Mrs. Gloria O. Amuveri, maintained that if such intervention funds became operational, monitoring and ensuring the quality of drugs would be enhanced.\r\n\r\n  She made the call recently in Kano, in an interview with the newsmen. “It gives effective checks and balances while monitoring the compliance to manufacturing practices,” she added.\r\n\r\n  According to her more people would be gainfully employed and the sources of drugs would also be known without any hitch, she lamented. With such funds, she explained, the Council could institutionalize the drugs distribution channels in the country.\r\n\r\n  “Another advantage we can derive from such funds is, we will now have more indigenous companies manufacturing what we consume. If indigenous companies are the ones manufacturing then we can do what is called marketing surveillance. We can also have what is called ‘Recall Processes and Procedures,’” the registrar emphasized.\r\n\r\n  Amuveri assured that that would also mean very good development to the entire healthcare system in the country.\r\n\r\n  On interns, she highlighted that the council was doing everything possible to encourage the state health facilities to ensure that they employed interns, being a continuous training process by the professionals. “We wrote to all the states in the federation that it was imperative that interns were employed by the state governments.

In collaboration with the brilliant team at MoveBackToNigeria.com, we hope to bring you a weekly interview with individuals who have successfully made the leap. The idea is to share their successes and their challenges as they made the decision.\r\n\r\nA lot of Nigerians in the diaspora have questions about making a change at home in Nigeria. Many suggest really good ideas on how to make things better; others would like to contribute to making a difference back home but are just not sure where to begin.\r\n\r\nThis week, we excitedly bring you a feature on a young Nigerian pharmacist (he  has chosen to remain anonymous) who is moving back to Nigeria to pursue his dreams in the health sector and beyond. Read on, to hear him talk about his career so far, his hopes and plans for his pharmaceutical practice and his take on the pharmaceutical industry in Nigeria. We hope you enjoy reading his story.\r\n\r\nThanks for agreeing to speak to us. Could you kindly tell us who you are?\r\nI’m a young Nigerian pharmacist, living and working in London, England and looking to move back to Nigeria in the next few months. My interests range from sports to music and everything in between.\r\n\r\nWhen did you leave Nigeria and why?\r\nI left Nigeria for the UK in 2001 for educational reasons.\r\n\r\nCan you shed some light on these educational reasons?\r\nSure. I left Nigeria after secondary school to do my A Levels in the UK and subsequently attend university there as well.  I studied pharmacy at Cardiff University and graduated with a Masters in Pharmacy.\r\n\r\nDid you always know you wanted to be a pharmacist?\r\nNot necessarily. Whilst I was proficient in science subjects, I was not always sure of what science I wanted to practice. My dad then decided on pharmacy and I’m happy to say it’s turned out to be a worthy decision.\r\n\r\nThat’s certainly fortunate. So how did your career in pharmacy begin?\r\nWell, it’s a seemingly convoluted path so do bear with me as I narrate. In the UK, after studying pharmacy, there’s a 1 year mandatory ‘pre-registration’ program (similar to the housemanship in medicine) which involves 1 year of working, shadowing a pharmacist and a very challenging professional exam afterwards. I undertook mine at Tesco Pharmacy, thankfully passed the exams and then registered as a pharmacist in the UK. I then went back to Cardiff University for another Masters degree, this time in Strategic Marketing as I felt that my business skills were lacking and I needed to remedy that. This I did for long term reasons because, I knew I would one day be going back to Nigeria to set up a pharmacy and I wanted to have the entrepreneurial skills necessary to market my drugs. After this degree, I got a job at Superdrug which lasted only briefly as the visa rules got changed and so I had to prematurely leave the UK for Nigeria.\r\n\r\nAlthough I was somewhat disillusioned at the prospect, I decided to use the opportunity to undertake the NYSC program. However, when I got home, I realised that I was misinformed about the NYSC procedure, particularly as it applies to graduates of medicine and pharmacy. You have to register as a pharmacist and then take a 6week course which is rotated nationwide and runs once annually, before being eligible for NYSC. I had unfortunately arrived months before the course and did not relish the prospect of waiting idly which led me to decide to come back to the UK for a third Masters degree, this time in Global Affairs at the University of Buckingham. I did this alongside a part-time pharmacist job in Boots and I stayed with them, even after the completion of my course while planning another move back to Nigeria; this time much more thought out and researched. After Boots, a better opportunity presented itself at Sainsbury’s Pharmacy and I took it and that’s where I currently work as the pharmacy manager.\r\n\r\nYou’ve mentioned a few times, your unwavering intent to return to Nigeria. Why this mindset?\r\nMoving back to Nigeria should be a decision based on personal circumstances. After all is said and done and despite the very well documented infrastructural and societal challenges in Nigeria, there’s still nowhere like home. I have a very good job in the UK and live a comfortable life but I feel that going home now is the right thing to do, for me.  I would like to be closer to my family, most of whom reside there and I would also like to set up my pharmacy practice in Nigeria, God willing. It is where I want to be and where I am happiest.\r\n\r\nWhilst I’m there, the intent is to get some hands on work experience, register my company and prepare for NYSC. Another reason is that there is a huge influx of pharmacists into the UK and so the money is not even what it used to be. The sector here is also getting very saturated for instance, because of EU laws, pharmacists from eastern Europe can come to the UK, shadow a pharmacist for a month and then get their license irrespective of whatever sort of training (or not) they may received in their home countries.\r\n\r\nThat’s understandable. You have discussed setting up your Pharmacy in Nigeria, can you go into some detail and tell us what this would entail?\r\nMy background in pharmacy and business has prepared me for this and it is something I want to do for a myriad of reasons. Operating a small, retail pharmacy is a profitable venture, it is also one that by its very nature will meet a very basic human need as I plan to site it close to schools, hospitals and potentially also specialise in certain medication(s), be a distributor, supplying private and public establishments and much more. I’m very optimistic about moving back and while I am very aware that things don’t always turn out as planned, particularly in the uncertain Nigerian terrain, I’m just hoping for the best.\r\n\r\nThis naturally leads us to the pharmaceutical industry in Nigeria and bodies like PCN & NAFDAC. What are your thoughts regarding these regulatory bodies?\r\nThe pharmaceutical industry in Nigeria is definitely progressing.  However, I feel we need to start manufacturing more medicines in Nigeria. The obvious infrastructural challenges certainly pose obstacles to this but it’s an area that should be better explored. We need more companies like Emzor, Orange Drugs and so on as a lot of medicines are currently imported from India and China which is not the route I would personally take if given the opportunity. There is more that can be done to increase our production especially considering we have the raw materials in abundance and a good example of this is maize starch which is a major component of most medicines.\r\n\r\nThe regulatory agencies like NAFDAC (National Agency for Food & Drug Administration and Control) and PCN (Pharmacists Council of Nigeria) need to be empowered and constitutionalized so as to be more effective and also to eliminate the crippling bureaucracy.  There are existing policies which go a long way towards curbing illegal practices. Many people are not aware of the existing industry rules and this is due to the fact that they are hardly enforced. One such rule is one in which if a businessman wants to set up a pharmacy, there must an in-house pharmacist who must own at least 40% of the business so as to ensure best practice. The PCN also needs to organise more public enlightenment campaigns for citizens to be aware of the laws and policies. For instance medication like Valium and Lexotan by law are prescription only in Nigeria but a lot of people flout these stipulations.\r\n\r\nWhat unique opportunities exist in the industry for people who may also be considering a move back?\r\nThere are many opportunities that abound, just take the size of Nigeria into consideration. There are 36 states in Nigeria with each one presenting a unique opportunity to whoever is interested and with the wherewithal to power the interest. For instance, I know someone who lives in Delta State but chooses to travel to the neighbouring Edo State to purchase medication for her kids when the need arises. There might be pharmacies close to her but she chooses to go all the way and it may be a function of the origin of the drugs sold by the pharmacies. She may just prefer European brands such as GSK or Roche to the Asian brands which are what abound in Nigeria and so here exists an opportunity for a business venture. Also, the WHO states that the fake drugs market In Africa is worth millions of dollars and we have a lot of people coming in from neighbouring countries like Ghana and Cameroon to buy medicines in Nigeria and so this is another opportunity to come in and present an ethical and alternative change.\r\n\r\nThis is all very enlightening and you’re clearly very passionate about this cause. Where then, do you see yourself and potentially, your pharmacy in 3 to 5 years?\r\nHopefully in a stable and successful position.  I intend to eventually expand and open more branches of my pharmacy as well as be a key player in the sector. I have already started the legwork and so with hard work and God’s blessings, the sky is just the foundation.\r\n\r\nThat’s certainly positive. On a final note and as you’re somewhat in the transition process, what would you say to people considering a similar move?\r\nYou need to know before you go. Do not just make hasty decisions. I see a lot of people you’ve interviewed on the MoveBackToNigeria.com website who’ve successfully made the move back home are either in the finance sector or the engineering sector and that’s understandable as those sectors are currently enjoying a boom. It is not the same for the health sector and anyone who does not do sufficient research will most likely encounter problems. Doctors are not doing so well back home except those who run their own clinics.\r\n\r\nAnother point to remember is that you need to be open-minded and not compare Nigerian systems to those in the west. It’s also important to be patient and hardworking and eventually, things should pay off.\r\n\r\n Thank you very much for your time and best wishes moving forward.', 4, '2013-09-26 09:53:39', 0, NULL, NULL),
(105, '\r\nCan Nigeria’s manufacturing, pharmaceutical industry compete? (2) – Prof.Soludo', 'The former Central Bank governor, Prof. Charles Soludo in a recent forum organised by Nigeria Association of Industrial Pharmacists (NAIP) in Lagos, has questioned the ability of Nigeria’s manufacturing and pharmaceutical industry to compete in the global market with certain indices pointing to that direction.\r\n\r\nAs I review the global industry, the structural shifts and market trends, I do not have good news for the audience here. I refer specifically to the pharmaceutical manufacturers among your membership. As of today, Nigeria has neither a comparative nor a competitive advantage in pharmaceuticals.\r\n\r\n(To deliberately create a competitive advantage will require serious strategizing and effort). On cost considerations, Nigerian firms cannot compete: the risk-adjusted rate of return on investment in the industry is comparatively very low. It is not surprising that the global majors in the industry are not pouring in capital. Estimated at about US$l,billion (less than 0.5% of Nigeria’s GDP and basically the size of a medium-sized pharmaceutical company abroad) the share of Nigeria’s, pharmaceutical industry in the global industry is basically zero.\r\n\r\nLocal manufacfure has been consistently losing market shares in the local market let alone being competitive in the international market. I understand that todate, none of the pharmaceutical companies in Nigeria is WHO- certified. If you adjust for the outsourced production to foreign firms, the 100 or so largely small and fragmented companies in the industry account for about 20% of domestic drug consumption.\r\n\r\nIt is a struggling industry. Some of the existing firms have resorted to a number of ‘survivalist strategies’ by joining the ‘trading train – as marketers for foreign firms or have outsourced their production to Indian and Chinese manufacturers while, they are more amply rewarded as happy importers. I will not be surprised if out of your 300 corporate members, more than 60% are in the marketing/distribution segment.\r\n\r\nI will not waste your time with a rehearsal of why and how the industry is not competitive. You probably have a better list of the reasons. The bottomline is that it is subject to the same competitive disadvantages as the productive sector especially manufacturing.\r\n\r\nThe industry cannot withstand the drug armada from China and India in particular – which have by far better cost advantages – and you cannot stop them from coming given our obligations under the General Agreement on Trade and Tariffs (GATT) and the World Trade Organization (WTO). Some of you complain that the industry is a victim of unfair trade (characterized by inflow of fake, illegal, substandard drugs or even ‘dumping’) while the government does little to ‘protect’ or patronize the industry.\r\n\r\nSome demand for special, cheaper funds for pharmaceuticals production. The list is long. I will argue that some of the proposals, if implemented, will merely act as short to medium term palliatives. In your language, administering only pain killers to a patient with malaria will not make him well.\r\n\r\nWhere do we go from here?\r\n\r\nSome analysts believe that the national development discourse is saddled with creeping analysis paralysis.\r\n\r\nPhilosophers, it is said, have interpreted the world: the problem is to change it! As I review the National Economic Empowerment and Development Strategy – NEEDS – or its revised version in the name of Vision 2020 document, the various ‘conclusions’ of the annual Nigerian Economic Summit, and the sundry ‘blueprints’ f1ying around you almost come to the conclusion that the missing link is a focused execution capacity.\r\n', 15, '2013-09-26 09:53:39', 0, NULL, NULL),
(106, 'Feasibility and effectiveness of a low cost campaign on antibiotic prescribing in Italy: community level, controlled, non-randomised trial', 'Electronic data routinely gathered in hospitals can be used as a warning system for missed doses of prescribed medicine and making improvements to patient safety, says a new study.\n\nA team from the Universities of Leicester and Birmingham found that the secondary use of data from an electronic prescribing and decision support system in an English hospital led to a ''substantial and sustained'' reduction in rates of missed or delayed doses of medicines.\n\nPublished in the world-leading health policy journal Milbank Quarterly, the study looked at how using the electronic system combined with organisational efforts helped to address a major patient safety threat.\n\nRoughly one in five patients in NHS hospitals miss a dose of prescribed medication or get it late. The National Patient Safety Agency has shown that omitted or delayed doses of essential drugs are a major problem, responsible for 27 deaths, 68 severe injuries and 21,283 patient safety incidents between 2006 and 2009 in the UK. But effective solutions for monitoring and reducing the problem have been hard to find.\n\nThe electronic system in the study hospital could be programmed to trigger a series of emails if, for example, a patient missed more than two doses of antibiotics. If no action was taken, these emails was be escalated upward, from ward nurse through the layers of the hospital, eventually to chief executive.\n\nProfessor Mary Dixon-Woods, Professor of Medical Sociology at the University of Leicester Department of Health Sciences, says: "This is one element of what we call ''technovigilance'' turning data into intelligence which can then be put into effective action. Other elements include using the electronic system to find examples of where care did not seem to meet the required standards, and holding high-level care omissions meetings with staff on clinical areas to find out what happened".\n\n''Technovigilance'' was credited with a fall in the rate of missed doses from 12% to 5%.\n\nDr Jamie Coleman of the University of Birmingham commented that: "Data generated by the system is used to make formerly hard-to-detect practices, behaviours and performance more transparent. This means necessary preventative action can be taken more easily."\n\nThe study found that these preventative actions included fixing organisational systems - such as delivery of medicines to specific locations - as well as emphasising the personal responsibility of individual staff. The hospital''s executive team credited technovigilance with a major "cultural shift" in staff attitudes towards administering medicines on time.\n\nIn an accompanying editorial, Professor David Bates of Harvard University comments that, "Such data can have a powerful effect on improvement. But in the rush to computerize, tools like this are not yet a routine component of most electronic health records. The overall implication is that all hospitals will need tools like this, and soon."\n\nBut technovigilance was not without its unintended consequences.\n\nDr Coleman says: "Technovigilance is intentionally used as a way of ensuring that individuals know their behaviour is being monitored and that they will be open to scrutiny. Although it''s not strictly intended to be punitive, being called to a care omissions meeting, for instance, could be a very uncomfortable experience for staff."\n\nOther unintended consequences found in the study included the risk that staff focused on the things being measured at the expense of other less measurable but important activities, or ''gaming'', where staff may try to create the appearance of better performance.\n\nProfessor Dixon-Woods commented: "One danger was that staff were so busy doing things that were going to be electronically monitored by the system that they did not have time to do other equally valuable things - such as talking to patients. We also identified concerns that the way the system was set up meant that nurses'' behaviour was subject to much more surveillance than others."\n\nThe model of technovigilance is now being optimised in light of findings from the study. The researchers stress that using alternative and complementary forms of intelligence, including evidence of patients'' experience and executive visits to clinical areas, may be important in countering the distorting effects of technovigilance and allowing a more complete picture of the quality and safety of patient care to emerge.

(107, '\r\nAppraising Nigeria’s need for a pharmaceutical intervention fund', 'Mr. Lolu Ojo, Chief Executive Officer of Merit HealthCare Limited and Chairman of the Nigerian Association of Industrial Pharmacists (NAIP) in this interview with BEN NDUBUWA spoke on the need for government to help the pharmaceutical industry grow through  patronage as well as putting in place policies to check the incidence of fake drugs.\r\n\r\nWhat are the challenges facing the pharmaceutical industry?\r\n\r\nThe challenges of the pharmaceutical industry in Nigeria are myriad just like every other sector of the economy. First we do not have a conducive environment to operate in. The truth is that the environment is hostile to business growth and development. However, we are determined and we have charged our people to rise above the harsh economic environment.  We believe that as the day goes by, we will survive and give thanks to God.\r\n\r\nWhat more can you say in an environment where you generate your own electricity, build your borehole for water, pay for security, build your roads and drainage, among others. For instance, in the past one month or so, we had no light because some vandals stole the cable from the transformer. So, everyday, we run the generator to keep the business going. For me this is one of the greatest challenges.\r\n\r\nAgain, as you are probably aware, 70 per cent of all the pharmaceutical products consumed in this country are actually imported. Therefore, any swing in the foreign exchange rate directly impact on our businesses. If, for instance, you had made an order for some products and there is a change in the exchange rate that is not favourable you will be in trouble. This is an economy where you cannot increase price arbitrarily because the customer is already complaining of the old price not being affordable.\r\n\r\n The upward swing in exchange rate, which had been our lot in the past few years, erodes our margin and limit our ability to expand, upgrade facilities, employ more people, take risks/higher challenges, etc. More so, banks’ interest rate is not better. It is the most unfriendly compared to what happens in other climes. We pay as much as 25 per cent or more.  The high cost of production is quite challenging.\r\n\r\nSome of our colleagues, including myself, are into importation not necessarily because we want to but more because it offers a more convenient platform to start business. I would have preferred to be in manufacturing and we have decided that, no matter what it is going to cost, we will start our own production soon. The fear all over the place is that of inadequate power supply. For instance, if your production line is busy producing and all of a sudden the power goes off and assuming my generator is faulty, the worst that will happen to me as an importer is the inconveniences of not being able to use the computer systems or the office, but, it is not the same for a manufacturer. The loss would be enormous.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nAs chairman of NAIP, what do you intend to achieve?\r\n\r\nNAIP is a technical arm of the Pharmaceutical Society of Nigeria (PSN). The members of NAIP are those pharmacists who are not in the hospitals, community pharmacy practice, or in the academia. We have a lot of pharmacists in the banks, in telecommunications, in the oil industry and other areas.  \r\n\r\n As a group, we are stronger and able to speak with bigger and louder voice and we can mobilise our members and engage in those things that will favour them. As a body, whether you are manufacturing, marketing or other forms of industrial pharmacy, the important thing is that we come together instead of having a cacophony of voices. That way, we have resemblance of orderliness and one voice.\r\n\r\nJust recently, we had a stakeholders’ meeting to streamline the process of handling product complaints. Not only that, just like any other association, we can call ourselves to order and we can call companies to order as well. If pharmacists that are working with companies and are not doing well, we call them to order. We have handled so many cases like that. We also work on development, For instance, we have set up a business academy called ‘NAIP Business Academy’.\r\n\r\nIt is a training institution and the objective is to fill the skill and knowledge gaps that we have observed in the industry. When we started as sales representative, we were trained for up to three to four months. This is hardly the case now. So, it has become imperative that the Association should set up such an institution for our members.\r\n\r\nIt is unfortunate the some multinationals that we take pleasure in condemning are the ones that took extra time to train us before allowing us to go to the field. This institution is to take care of this gap created by the exit of some of these companies.  Unfortunately, the multinationals left because of the difficult operating environment. The Pfizer, Bayer, Roche, etc, they all left Nigeria then, though they are coming back but not as big as they were before their exit. Most of them now have a simple marketing office in the country.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nWhat Is attracting the multinationals back?\r\n\r\nYou cannot ignore Nigeria. The whole world is looking towards Nigeria as the next place for investment. Do you know what is happening in America and Europe now? Africa and Nigeria is surely the next destination for investment. You cannot ignore 160 million people. I learnt about the assertion of the CEO of Shoprite if as it is being widely circulated that 60 percent of Nigerians are living below poverty level, the remaining 40 percent that are probably above the poverty line is more than the population of South Africa.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nHow is your relationship with NAFDAC?         \r\n\r\nOur relationship with NAFDAC is normal but not optimal. I sincerely hope that before the end of my tenure as the national chairman of NAIP, the relationship will get better. I had actually led a delegation of NAIP members to the DG of NAFDAC’s office to declare our support and readiness to work with the agency. As a gentle man, he is good; his intentions are genuine and altruistic. There is need for more contact.\r\n\r\n A delegation of PSN recently met the DG and it was agreed that we need to interact more irrespective our differences for the good of the nation. Unfortunately, I could not attend that meeting because of other pressing and earlier scheduled NAIP assignment. We need to discuss and agree on issues and interventions in a free atmosphere before execution. Some issues or interventions like anti-faking devices, etc need the support of everybody for success.\r\n\r\nNAFDAC is a regulating institution and not a ‘strangulator’. The pharmaceutical industry form more than 80 per cent of NAFDAC’s clientele base. Therefore, we need each other for the sector to be vibrant. It is to our interest for a regulatory body like NAFDAC to be vibrant and alive to her responsibilities.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nHow do you feel about fake drugs coming from Asian countries?    \r\n\r\nUntil we change our attitude it will continue. The people bringing in fake drugs are Nigerians. Whether it is Musa, Okechukwu, Laolu or Ekaitte the thing is that they are Nigerians. There is nothing wrong with India or China. All the products you see on the shelves in Europe and America are from China and India; these drugs are made there because the cost of production is low. It is our people that go to tell these people don’t worry instead of 250 mg make it 50mg and label it 250mg and ship it to me I will sell them. What we tell our people is that they should buy from the right source.', 5, '2013-09-26 09:53:39', 0, NULL, NULL),

(109, 'PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY IN NIGERIA IS FACING TOUGH TIME', 'Nnamdi Okafor\r\nThis may not be the best of times for the pharmaceutical industry in the country as the sector is still grappling with tough challenges that simply refuse to go away after many concerted efforts. According to Mr Nnamdi Okafor, the CEO, May & Baker Plc, the problems, which range from intense competition, low capacity utilization, serious faking and adulteration of original brands and even low buying power of customers, have been giving the industry a reputation of low profitability and return on investment.\r\n\r\nBut how does he intend to go through with these problems as the new helmsman of a 67-year-old healthcare institution?\r\n\r\n''I have my ideas on where I want to take the company which is also in tandem with the corporate vision.

Okafor said at an interactive session with media men, his first ever since assuming office, where he bared it all on his roadmap to take the company to its promised land.

He became the managing director of May & Baker Nigeria Plc on February 1, 2011 following the appointment of his predecessor, Dr Joseph Odumodu, as the Director-General of the Standards Organisation of Nigeria (SON).\r\n\r\nHe holds a Bachelor of Pharmacy degree from the then University of Ife, Ile-Ife (now Obafemi Awolowo University, Ife) as well as Master of Business Administration (MBA) in Marketing from ESUT Business School, Lagos.

''This we intend to accomplish by developing a strategic mindset, putting our business on a rapid, stable and sustainable growth path, building systems and processes that function seamlessly and developing appetite for stretch financial goals. We are already working on a new strategic plan which will form the new road map for our journey towards our vision.''\r\n\r\nIn this piece, he shed more light on how he intends to achieve this lofty ideals.\r\n\r\nExcerpts:\r\nBackground\r\nI became the managing director of May & Baker Nigeria Plc on February 1, 2011. As you are aware, the transition became necessary when our immediate past managing director, Dr Joseph Odumodu, was appointed the Director-General of the Standards Organisation of Nigeria (SON) by the President. I am not new to the May & Baker family, having spent the 25 years of my working life in the company. If anything, I can say with every sense of modesty that I am indeed on a familiar terrain having also been on the board of this company as executive director for the past eight years.\r\n\r\nMy participation in the management of this company over these years has given me good knowledge of the business and will help me avoid past mistakes in trying to chart a new course for the company. However, it has its potential pitfall which is a tendency to perpetrate status quo. I can however assure you that the latter will not be the case here.\r\n\r\nThis is because the first thing I did on assumption of this new role is to reset my clock to my first day at work in May & Baker. This is to enable me see opportunities for change. It is clear to me that the only way to move this business to a new level is by implementing change through injection of new ideas and ways of doing things. So we will implement change. But we shall not implement change for the sake of change, we will only implement changes that will enhance our processes, business results and ultimately shareholder value.\r\n\r\nVision\r\nI want to put it on record the fact that I inherited a good company. Our former managing director did a fantastic job in his 22 years of service to this company, 13 of which were spent at the helm of affairs. He navigated this company through its most turbulent years and put it on a sound pedestal with impressive revenue and profit growth, robust asset base and strong corporate reputation. So we are standing on a solid ground and are very proud of what he accomplished.\r\n\r\nOn this note, permit me to give you an outline of my vision for the company and the strategic direction of the new management. May and Baker has a corporate vision which is ''To Be Among the Top 10 Conglomerates in Nigeria by 2020''. That vision remains unchanged because we believe it is the best we can have at this time. It was the collective decision of the management team taken at a strategic retreat three years ago and we shall vigorously pursue this dream.\r\n\r\nHowever, I have my ideas on where I want to take the company which is also in tandem with the corporate vision. We want to take this good company that has been handed over to us and turn it into a great company. A truly strong and stable world-class company powered by strong global brands, aggressive business diversification, optimum business process efficiency and good corporate governance principles.\r\n\r\nTo me the strength of a company is a reflection of the strength of its brands. So we intend to increase our support for our brands.\r\n\r\nWe recognize that May & Baker is a strong brand and we shall continue to build on that strength. However we also recognize that this equity is only strong with the older generation. Therefore we will deliberately target the younger generation with products and corporate social responsibility initiatives that will appeal to their lifestyle. Our strategic intent is to make May & Baker one of the fastest growing and profitable businesses in it''s category.\r\n\r\nThis we intend to accomplish by; developing a strategic mindset, putting our business on a rapid, stable and sustainable growth path, building systems and processes that function seamlessly and developing appetite for stretch financial goals. We are already working on a new strategic plan which will form the new road map for our journey towards our vision. This plan will be unveiled in the next three months and guide all our subsequent investments and resource deployment.\r\n\r\nCSR\r\nIn May & Baker we have supported the society through various sponsorships and donations to individuals, professional groups, governmental and non-governmental bodies. We intend to move a step further by being a credible source of information on public health and safety education, awareness and disease prevention. To achieve these objectives we are interested in partnering with societies and groups that invest in social wellbeing\r\n\r\nNew plant\r\nAs some of you are aware, May & Baker started a new pharmaceutical plant in Ota in 2008. It is a world class plant designed to blaze the trail in Nigeria as the country''s first WHO pre-Qualified pharmaceutical facility. This feat is meant to be not only a corporate accomplishment but also a national achievement. With it, Nigeria will be recording another first in West and Central Africa because the plant would be the first of its kind in these sub-regions. When fully certified by the WHO, the pharma plant in Ota will open a gateway to international business as well as help conserve the country''s foreign exchange in the area of drugs. This facility will be open to both local and international drug procuring entities who currently buy from Western and Asian manufacturers.\r\n\r\nThe facility, which has taken investment in excess of N3 billion, is now near completion and will have a capacity of about 30 billion tablets and 25 million bottles per annum working only two eight-hour shifts per day. This, in addition to our current capacities at the Ikeja factory, will represent a significant percentage of Nigeria''s drug requirement. The successful take-off of this plant in a short time is a major objective of the new management. In the years ahead we shall remain focused while playing on high stakes. We have plans to take full advantage of new openings in the economy and shall vigorously pursue opportunities in the export business especially within the West African sub region under the common external tariff programme of ECOWAS.\r\n\r\nWHO certification\r\nWe are not the only company in Nigeria that is going for the World Health Organization (WHO) certification . But I believe that we have the best chance of getting it because we have the best chance of getting it because we have the best facility. The process of getting WHO certification is a long process. It takes up to 18 months. It is a long process of documentation and it is also a political process. We are working very hard to get it in record time and I want to also say that NAFDAC is doing a very good job in this area by trying to assist companies which are ready to collaborate with WHO. We are going to Geneva next month(April) for a workshop meant to open up an avenue where drug manufacturers would interact with WHO officials who are in charge of this process.\r\n\r\nThat will facilitate the time frame for achieving it.\r\n\r\nChallenges\r\nYou know, the new plant is a very massive project. And I would say that we underestimated what would be involved. And as the project gets towards completion stage, we have challenges. So we have challenges with some of our contractors who started appealing for reviews and reviews. And at some point, we could not continue to grant such requests. So we have to change the main contractor who was working on the project. And in doing so, we lost some months-about two or three months. But I want to reassure you that that factory will start test running by the end of this month (March). We should be ready to start running on some products by the end of this month. And before the end of half year, we should officially commission that facility.\r\n\r\nThe year 2011 promises to be a very uncertain year for business generally. The reasons among others include the April general elections, adverse weather conditions in Asia and impact on food prices, revolution in the Middle East and impact on crude oil supply and prices and the overall impact of all these on inflation and purchasing power of an average Nigerian. As you are all aware, the pharmaceutical industry has been challenged over the years by various issues ranging from intense competition, low capacity utilization, serious faking and adulteration of original brands and even low buying power of customers.\r\n\r\nThis has given the industry a reputation of low profitability and return on investment. However at May and Baker Nigeria PLC, rather than being deterred by these negative signals, we have decided to drive our business and have performed above industry average. Our key strategies for higher performance in 2011 include stronger support for our brands especially our foods brand Mimee Noodles, broadening of our products offering and expected increase in output following commissioning of our Ota plant.\r\n\r\nWe are embarking on various expansion projects to deliver an enviable company for all. What we promise the shareholders is that we shall continue to make their investments in our company worthwhile by ensuring that they enjoy the benefits accruable from a strong entity in terms of returns on investment, capital appreciation and security of investment. We intend to excite our shareholders with more robust dividends.\r\n\r\nProducts\r\nCrunch Mee is still in the market but I must say it is not doing as much as we have wanted. The reason is that consumers seem not to like the way it is presented. People want it to be in form that would be easier for them to manage. At some point, we had to change its flavour and in that way improve its acceptability. We are in the process of reformulating it. But for it to get to the level that we want , the form will have to change and that will also involve some capital expenses. And because we are struggling to finish the one that we are doing, we are not in a hurry to put in money in buying machines for now. Mimee too is not out of the market.\r\n\r\nWe are very much in the market. Mimee is also not operating at 100 per cent capacity. We still have some spare capacity. What is happening is that that industry has full capacity. Some people came in, Dangote came in, Flourmills came in, Honeywell has been there. So we have a lot of capacity. In fact, Dangote built three factories and as I talk to you now, only one is functioning. The other two are down because the operators in the industry, unfortunately, are not expanding demand at the pace in which capacity was going up. There is some tough competition going on. That is why we have decided to, on our own, do something about demand. Very soon, we are going to be breaking our new campaign. And that campaign, I believe, is meant to sensitise the consumers and to get more people to try Mimee.\r\n\r\nAdulteration\r\nI am aware that some 10 years ago, this was a very bad situation because it was being done on two fronts: One, people were doing their own here and some were going outside Nigeria to also adulterate or fake these products. NAFDAC has done a lot to stem the tide. I would say that the incidence of adulteration has significantly come down. However, we still have issues of products being faked from time to time. I know we have encountered some of our products that were faked outside the country and brought in. And what we did was to quickly get in touch with NAFDAC.\r\n\r\nAnd working with NAFDAC, we were able to round up some of the parties that were involved in it because it was a very big cartel. What we have to do was trying to apply the break to whatever they had done and possibly confiscate the items. But beyond that, the legal system is a bit difficult to go through and we were not being prepared to go the whole hog of trying to imprison the people behind these things. But we just want to keep them uncomfortable and ensure that we dissuade them from continuing.\r\n\r\nOn the issue of faking, if you have followed the trend of the fakers, you will find out that they are evolving. One of the initiatives that we have also subscribed to is the use of identification code for the products. A lot of the products that can easily be faked would have some codes that people can pick up, and send SMS to a particular number and then get confirmation whether such product is genuine or not. As I said, the fakers are evolving, this is technology. For now, I am not sure they have been able to beat that particular system. So we are adopting it. And we keep looking at better ways to handle such situation.\r\n\r\nLiabilities\r\nIt is true that when you inherit assets, you also inherit liabilities. We know the environment that we are operating in and we know that everything is not rosy. And as business, we have liabilities. Of course, the first one is the fact that we need to build stronger brand as a company because that would help us to weather the storm, I mean when there is shock and withstand that shock in the system. If you have very strong brand, you will be able to withstand it.\r\n\r\nOf course, the fact that we are building a factory and we are borrowing money, we will also be paying interest on these funds. And what that means is that it would put some pressure on cash to run the business. That is one area that I am looking at with the Finance Director. That is what I can say for now. We will continue to improve on the good job that the past MD did. And there is always room for improvement.\r\n\r\nFuture plan\r\nWe are set to intensify our drive for rapid business expansion and diversification. We have already concluded plans to deepen our activities in current markets and enter new markets with new exciting products through parent and subsidiary companies. We are also at the verge of expanding our activities into new geographic markets including aggressive Inroads into export markets. We have in place established processes, procedures, policies and control systems that have guided our operations. Notwithstanding that these systems are working satisfactorily, we intend to look at some of them again with a view to making them more efficient. So we intend to continually fine tune our systems, processes and procedures for higher efficiency and better results.\r\n\r\nOur work force remains our most valuable assets. We are proud to have a rare assemblage of highly qualified and dedicated staff. This is made possible because May & Baker has a highly transparent recruitment process that ensures that only people who demonstrate the right competencies, mental and psychological disposition are employed. We shall provide the right environment and training for these talents to blossom into world class work force. We intend to adopt best practices in corporate governance. We shall run the business with the highest level of integrity and compliance with all relevant laws and regulations.\r\n\r\nAdvice\r\nOne thing that I want to say is that we are lucky as a country that we are exporting crude oil. So when the price of this crude oil goes up in the international market, and now that the Niger Delta situation is a bit under control, what this means is that we are going to export more crude; we are going to earn more revenue. The only thing that I would like to request is that the way this money is utilized will make a whole lot of difference.\r\n\r\nAs against what happens now, I mean the sharing of the money among the states and nobody can really accounts for what comes out of the extra windfall, the Federal Government should try to use this money to improve on infrastructure. Because a lot of people in the country are doing nothing because there is no power. For instance , imagine that we have 24 hours power supply, a lot of people will be working and also generate income for themselves. And that would reduce the difficulties that people are facing. It is important that government applies whatever resources(at its disposal) well.\r\n\r\nAnd like what is happening in some countries, food is very critical. The Federal Government should continue with what they are doing, which is subsidizing inputs of agriculture, which is important. And if it is possible, like it is being done in other parts of the world, subsidise some critical commodities like flour. The cost of flour has gone up and Nigerians like bread a lot. This means that they have to pay more for it. I think that the government should step in for such important items to see how the cost can be put under control.

With the determining factor in the pharmaceutical business dependent on increasing disease pattern, over-the-counter (OTC) medicines such as analgesics, antimalarials and multivitamins make up a large share of the Nigerian market. Painkillers, also known as analgesics or antipyretics, have the largest market share of therapeutic classes of medicines locally produced due to their affordability, availability and widespread use for a wide range of symptoms.\r\n\r\nThis revelation, contained in a recent document review of the nation’s pharmaceutical sector tagged “Global United Nations Industrial Development Organisation (UNIDO) Project”, shows that analgesics constitute 25 percent of drugs produced in the country. Others include antibiotics (15 percent), multivitamins + haematinics (15 percent), antimalarial medicines (14 percent), antihypertensives (8 percent), cough and cold preparations (5 percent), antiretroviral medicines (6 percent), external/topical preparations (5 percent), antiTB medicines (4 percent), and others (3 percent).\r\n\r\nThe report shows that the existing large market size, strong demand and the need for management of infectious diseases, especially HIV/AIDS, malaria, TB, and neglected childhood diseases constitute enormous opportunity for pharmaceutical firms to produce therapeutic drugs to meet the health needs of Nigerians.\r\n\r\nCurrently, Nigeria is responsible for about 60 percent of medicines consumed in the ECOWAS by volume, underlining the huge sub-regional market of an estimated 600 million people, according to Pharmaceutical Manufacturing Group, Manufacturers’ Association of Nigeria (PMG-MAN). Trade incentives introduced by ECOWAS for pharmaceuticals within West Africa are helping to promote movement of pharmaceuticals within the sub-region, experts believe. Furthermore, the West African Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association (WAPMA) is working to enhance confidence in the quality of medicines produced locally and promote business in the sub-region.\r\n\r\nEstimates of the size of the nation’s pharmaceutical market vary. Business Monitor International (BMI) in 2009 estimated Nigeria’s pharmaceutical market at $600 million. Out of this figure, BMI attributes the largest share of $418 million to generic medicines, $121 million to OTC products, and $61 million to patented products.\r\n\r\nEqually, Frost & Sullivan, a growing partnership company, estimated a pharmaceutical market value of $740 million in 2009. Out of this figure, $266.4 million was attributed to generic medicines, $177.6 million to branded products, and $296 million to OTC products.\r\n\r\nDrug manufacturers in the country are faced with several constraints, including low capacity utilisation, under-capitalisation, a weak financial base, high production costs, as well as difficulty in meeting WHO prequalification criteria.\r\n\r\nHowever, with some pharmaceutical firms such as Evans, SWIPHA, CHI Pharmaceuticals, May and Baker, and Fidson Healthcare plc in the process of upgrading and/or building new facilities in preparation to meet these prequalification requirements, we believe this development will promote local production, given the increased opportunity to participate in international tenders, such as WHO, United Nations Children Fund (UNICEF), United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), UNITAID and the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, TB and Malaria. No doubt, WHO prequalification will help the nation to become self-sufficient in the manufacture of essential medicines, which will invariably have multiplier effects on the economy with creation of thousands of jobs and more foreign exchange earnings for the country.\r\n\r\nNigeria can learn from the India experience. The emergence of India’s pharmaceutical industry on the global landscape as a strong generics player allowed only process patents in pharmaceutical products. This development kept the cost of medicines at affordable levels by enabling domestic pharmaceutical firms to build technical expertise in reverse engineering of existing medicines by modifying the manufacturing process, thereby becoming efficient producers of generic drugs.', 9, '2013-09-26 11:54:36', 0, NULL, NULL),
(112, 'Pharmaceutical industry needs intervention fund, says PCN ', 'A local low-cost information campaign mainly targeted at citizens and involving doctors and pharmacists can significantly decrease total antibiotic prescribing, finds a paper published on bmj.com.\n\nThe excessive use of antibiotics is associated with resistance to these drugs and an increasing threat to global health. Antibiotics are also often unnecessarily and inappropriately prescribed. This is an issue that has been frequently addressed by health information campaigns.\n\nCampaigns can be moderately effective in restricting the excessive use of antibiotics although limits in study design make their evaluation difficult.\n\nItaly has among the highest antibiotic use in Europe. There has, however, been a decrease in the last few years to coincide with two national information campaigns, but without direct involvement from health professionals.\n\nResearchers from Italy therefore looked to evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of a local information campaign, aimed at reducing antibiotic prescriptions by increasing awareness on threats of unnecessary use. They wanted to test the hypothesis that a campaign could be feasibly implemented within Local Health Authorities and reduce antibiotic prescriptions.\nThe study was a community level, controlled trial: the campaign was implemented in the Italian provinces of Modena and Parma from 2011-2012. Provinces in the same region where no campaign had been implemented were used as the control group. The main target was the general population.\n\nThe material used in the campaign suggested that antibiotics are necessary in specific circumstances, do not work in the case of flu or colds and should be used when doctors prescribe them. The campaign motto was: "Antibiotics, solution or problem?". The following material was used: posters; brochures; videos in high accessed places such as pharmacies and waiting rooms; two episodes of a talk TV show; radio segments; advertisements in local newspapers; web sites; and newsletters on antibiotic resistance directed at prescribers.\n\nThe main outcome was the average prescribing rate of antibiotics to outpatients during five months. Secondary outcomes included five month change in outpatient antibiotic expenditure per 1000 inhabitants / day and knowledge of, attitudes and reported behaviour about the campaign messages.\n\nThe average outpatient prescribing rates corresponded to decreases of 11.9% in the intervention area and 7.4% in the control area, compared with the same five month period of the previous year. The corresponding decrease in the rest of Italy was 3.2%.\n\nA statistical model correcting for baseline differences found a 4.3%, statistically significant difference in antibiotic prescribing between the intervention and the control area. This difference was not linked to any difference in hospital admissions, or to changes in knowledge and attitudes of the population. As for antibiotic expenditure, an estimate of its reduction ranges from € 200,000 to € 406,000 (€0.17 to €0.35 per resident).\n\nThe researchers say that the study shows the effectiveness of a local, small scale information campaign on antibiotics, carried out by local health authorities, and the potential advantage of local implementation such as involving doctors and pharmacists and adapting messages and tools to the local context. They say a "common lesson may be that large decreases in antibiotic prescription should not be expected, especially if a decreasing trend was already apparent since the previous years", but it is reassuring that the decrease in prescribing was "more pronounced than in the remaining parts of the country".\n\nThey conclude that reduced prescribing of antibiotics was "mediated by doctors'' endorsement of the campaign goals and/or by an ''awareness of the campaign'' factor, rather than by decreased patient pressure to get antibiotics". They add that change in people''s knowledge and attitudes may require longer term exposure, but the availability of information, put in a proper context, could create a favourable climate for potentially relevant societal changes or changes in decision making even if that information does not influence the population directly targeted.', 10, '2013-09-27 22:22:45', 1, NULL, NULL);
